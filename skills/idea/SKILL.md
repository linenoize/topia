# idea

## Purpose

Idea Elicitation agent — the ROOT FIX for "Claude works a lot but produces nothing." `idea` forces deep understanding of WHAT to build before any code is written. It asks probing questions, identifies hidden requirements, maps stakeholders, defines scope boundaries, and produces a structured Requirements Document.

> Wrong requirements shipped correctly is the most expensive bug. idea's job is to prevent it — measure clarity (Step 2.5), measure completeness (Step 3.5), and measure cross-dimension consistency (Step 3.6) before handoff.

<HARD-GATE>
idea produces WHAT, not HOW. Never write code. Never plan implementation.
Output is a Requirements Document → hand off to topia:plan for implementation planning.
</HARD-GATE>

## Triggers

- Called by `build` Phase 1 when task is product-oriented (not a simple bug fix)
- Called by `scaffold` Phase 1 before any project generation
- `/topia idea <requirement>` — manual invocation
- Auto-trigger: when user description is > 50 words OR contains business terms (users, revenue, workflow, integration)

## Calls (outbound)

- `recon` (L2): scan existing codebase for context
- `research` (L3): look up similar products, APIs, integrations
- `plan` (L2): hand off Requirements Document for implementation planning
- `brainstorm` (L2): when multiple approaches exist for a requirement
- `design` (L2): when requirements include UI/UX components — hand off visual requirements
- `problem-solver` (L3): structured reasoning when requirements have conflicting constraints

## Called By (inbound)

- `build` (L1): before Phase 2 PLAN, when task is non-trivial
- `scaffold` (L1): Phase 1, before any project generation
- `plan` (L2): when plan receives vague requirements
- `documentation` (L2): reads requirements and plan artifacts for leadership package
- `mcp-builder` (L2): requirements elicitation before MCP server design
- User: `/topia idea` direct invocation

## Cross-Hub Connections

- `idea` → `plan` — idea produces requirements, plan produces implementation steps
- `idea` → `brainstorm` — idea calls brainstorm when multiple requirement approaches exist
- `idea` ↔ `build` — build calls idea for non-trivial tasks, idea feeds requirements into build's pipeline
- `idea` → `scaffold` — scaffold requires idea output before project generation

## Executable Steps

### Step 1.2 — Neural Memory Retrieval (SEARCH)

Before eliciting new information, search `topia:neural-memory` for related concepts, prior versions of this idea, or similar features built in other projects.

1.  **Extract keywords**: Identify core concepts from the user's initial prompt (e.g., "auth", "payment", "RAG").
2.  **Search Memory**: Query `topia:neural-memory` with these keywords.
3.  **Optional — agora-code recall**: if the `agora-memory` MCP server is registered, also call its `recall_learnings` tool with the same keywords. Findings from agora-code reflect prior cross-session learnings (decisions, gotchas, rejected approaches) — merge with neural-memory results. Skip silently if MCP unavailable. See `docs/mcp-integrations/agora-code.md`.
4.  **Synthesize Findings**:
    *   If a similar idea exists: *"I found a related idea in memory: [Concept]. We previously decided [Decision]. Should we leverage those patterns or is this a different direction?"*
    *   If technical patterns exist: *"I recall we used [Library/Pattern] for a similar task previously. I'll keep that in mind as a constraint."*

### Step 1 — Intake & Classify

Read the user's request. Classify the requirement type:

| Type | Signal | Depth |
|------|--------|-------|
| Feature Request | "add X", "build Y", "I want Z" | Full idea cycle (Steps 1-7) |
| Bug Fix | "broken", "error", "doesn't work" | skip idea → direct to debug |
| Refactor | "clean up", "refactor", "restructure" | Light idea (Step 1 + Step 4 only) |
| Integration | "connect X to Y", "integrate with Z" | Full idea + API research |
| Greenfield | "new project", "build from scratch" | Full idea + market context |

If Bug Fix → skip idea, route to build/debug directly.
If Refactor → light version (Step 1 + Step 4 only). Skip Steps 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 6.

If existing codebase → invoke `topia:recon` for context before proceeding.

### Step 1.4 — Synthesis Trigger Check
<MUST-READ path="references/synthesis-mode.md" trigger="when prior conversation already contains rich requirement context (pasted spec, > 1000 words discussion, continuation session, filled issue template)"/>

Before proceeding to elicitation, check whether the requirements are **already in context**. Re-asking what the user already told you is the second-most expensive bug.

Activate **Synthesis Mode** instead of standard elicitation if ANY of:

| Signal | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| User pasted a spec / PRD / brief | > 200 words describing the feature |
| Conversation has > 1000 words on this feature | Sufficient context already gathered |
| User said "synthesize" / "I already explained" / "just write the spec" | Explicit synthesis request |
| Continuation — `.topia/features/<name>/requirements.md` exists with prior answers | Re-elicitation would duplicate |
| Issue tracker has filled-in template (problem, story, acceptance criteria) | Source already structured |

In Synthesis Mode: extract answers from existing context, draft the Requirements Document with **source citations** for every section, then **confirm** rather than re-interview. Ask follow-ups ONLY on the 1-2 dimensions with genuine gaps. Skip steps 2, 2.5 if all 5 dimensions are filled or partial-but-acceptable.

Workflow detail + anti-patterns: [references/synthesis-mode.md](references/synthesis-mode.md).

### Step 1.5 — Out-of-Scope Match Check (READ)

Before any elicitation, check whether the request matches a concept previously rejected.

1. `Glob` `.out-of-scope/*.md` — if directory absent, skip silently.
2. For each file, parse YAML frontmatter (`concept`, `aliases`).
3. Build a token map (lowercased, split on `-` and whitespace).
4. Tokenize the user's request the same way.
5. Compute lexical overlap per concept; keep the top match's `confidence` (0.0–1.0).

**Action by confidence**:

| Confidence | Verdict | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| ≥ 0.8 | exact-match | Surface to user: *"This matches a prior rejection (`.out-of-scope/<slug>.md`) — closed because [body's "Why out of scope" first sentence]. Do you still feel the same way?"* Pause for user response before continuing. |
| 0.5 – 0.79 | similar | Mention inline: *"This is similar to a prior rejection (`<slug>`). Would you like to review it before we proceed?"* Continue regardless of answer. |
| < 0.5 | no-match | Continue silently, no user-facing mention. |

Emit `outofscope.match` signal with `{concept, confidence, verdict}` so downstream skills (build, plan) inherit the context.

If verdict is exact-match AND user says "yes I still want it" → record their override reason in the Requirements Document `## Risks` section AND mark `priority_to_revisit: high` in the existing `.out-of-scope/<slug>.md` (do NOT delete the file). The override forces the candidate up the revisit ladder; it doesn't erase the prior decision.

If verdict is exact-match AND user accepts the prior rejection → end the idea session with a one-line summary referencing the file. No further questions.

Format reference: [references/out-of-scope-format.md](references/out-of-scope-format.md).

### Step 1.6 — Mid-Elicitation Reject WRITE Path

If the user **explicitly rejects** the feature at any point during elicitation (Steps 2-3) — common phrases: "scrap it", "actually nah, don't build this", "we won't do this", "kill the feature", "drop it" — STOP elicitation and **write a `.out-of-scope/<slug>.md` record** before ending the session.

Without this WRITE path, oral rejections vanish — the next session re-asks the same questions and the user has to re-reject. Step 1.5 (READ) only catches matches against existing files; Step 1.6 (WRITE) is what produces those files in the first place.

<HARD-GATE>
Mid-elicitation rejection MUST produce a `.out-of-scope/<slug>.md` file before session end.
A rejection without a written record is a rejection that didn't happen.
</HARD-GATE>

**Procedure**:

1. **Confirm rejection is durable, not deferral**. Ask one clarifier:
   > "Just to record this correctly: is this **out of scope** (project doesn't want this), or **deferred** (not now but maybe later)? Out-of-scope gets recorded so we don't re-litigate; deferred goes to backlog instead."

   - If **deferred** → route to backlog (no `.out-of-scope/` write), end session with a one-line note
   - If **out-of-scope** → continue to step 2

2. **Capture the durable reason**. Ask:
   > "What's the reason this is out of scope? (project scope, technical constraint, strategic decision — not a temporary circumstance)"

   If the user gives a temporary reason ("we're busy"), reframe: "That's a deferral — should I route to backlog instead?"

3. **Generate slug** (kebab-case, ≤40 chars, recognizable without opening the file).

4. **Lexical-similarity check**: `Glob` `.out-of-scope/*.md`, parse each frontmatter's `concept` + `aliases`, compute overlap. If any existing concept has ≥0.7 overlap → APPEND to that file's `prior_requests` list and mark `rejected_by: idea` for this round. Do NOT create a duplicate.

5. **Write the file** using the format in [`references/out-of-scope-format.md`](references/out-of-scope-format.md):
   - YAML frontmatter (`concept`, `aliases`, `decision: rejected`, `rejected_at`, `rejected_by: idea`, `prior_requests`, optional `revisit_if`)
   - Markdown body: concept name, "Why out of scope" (substantive reasoning from step 2), "What would change our mind" (if user volunteered signals)

6. **Emit `outofscope.recorded`** signal carrying `{slug, rejected_by: idea, prior_requests_count}` so downstream skills know a new rejection landed.

7. **End idea session** with one-line summary:
   > "Recorded as out of scope in `.out-of-scope/<slug>.md`. Future similar requests will surface this. Override anytime by editing the file."

**When NOT to write**:

- User merely defers ("not now") → backlog, not `.out-of-scope/`
- User rejects a single requirement within a larger feature → adjust requirements doc Boundaries section, don't write a whole rejection file (the feature is still in scope)
- Bug rejections (already fixed, not reproducible) → not idea's job; route to incident or close the issue
- The match was already exact (≥0.8) and Step 1.5 surfaced it — user accepting the prior rejection just appends to `prior_requests` of the existing file (handled in Step 1.5 path)

### Step 2.0 — Explore-First Pre-Check (HARD-GATE)

Before emitting ANY of the 5 elicitation questions, run the 4-item pre-check on each intended question:

1. Is the answer in `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `Cargo.toml` / `go.mod` / `pom.xml`?
2. Is the answer in `README.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `docs/`?
3. Is it inferable from file extensions, directory structure, or config files?
4. Has the user answered it earlier in this conversation?

<HARD-GATE>
For every question Q the agent intends to ask, there MUST be prior tool-call evidence in the same session:
- At least 1 Read / Glob / Grep related to Q's domain, OR
- Explicit declaration: "Q cannot be answered from project artifacts because [specific reason]."
Without one of these, Q is BLOCKED — re-route to inference.
</HARD-GATE>

The gate is "tried to infer" — not "must succeed in inferring." If the file genuinely doesn't have the answer, the attempt itself is the gate.

Cache inferred answers in the requirements doc:
```
**Inferred from package.json**: TypeScript 5.4, Next.js 14.2, React 18.3
**Inferred from .github/workflows/**: CI runs on PRs targeting main
```

Worked examples + edge cases: [references/explore-first.md](references/explore-first.md).

### Step 2 — Requirement Elicitation (the "5 Questions")

Ask exactly 5 probing questions, ONE AT A TIME (not all at once):

1. **WHO** — "Who is the end user? What's their technical level? What are they doing right before and after using this feature?"
2. **WHAT** — "What specific outcome do they need? What does 'done' look like from the user's perspective?"
3. **WHY** — "Why do they need this? What problem does this solve? What happens if we don't build it?"
4. **BOUNDARIES** — "What should this NOT do? What's explicitly out of scope?"
5. **CONSTRAINTS** — "Any technical constraints? (existing APIs, performance requirements, security needs, deadlines)"

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT skip questions. Do NOT answer your own questions.
If user says "just build it" → respond with: "I'll build it better with 2 minutes of context. Question 1: [WHO]"
Each question must be asked separately, wait for answer before next.
Exception: if user provides a detailed spec/PRD → extract answers from it, confirm with user.
</HARD-GATE>

#### Question Discipline (MANDATORY)

Every question the user answers burns attention you don't get back. Protect it.

1. **Max 5 questions total across the whole idea session.** If you find yourself wanting a 6th, the answer is in the first 5 or you're stalling — re-read, don't re-ask.
2. **Prefer yes/no or multiple-choice over open-ended.** An open-ended question is a last resort when no reasonable option set exists.
   - BAD: "What auth strategy do you want?"
   - GOOD: "Auth: **(a)** email+password with JWT, **(b)** OAuth (Google/GitHub), **(c)** magic link, **(d)** I'll decide — pick one."
3. **Never ask what you can infer.** If the answer is in the repo, the user's message, or the classification from Step 1 — don't ask it.
   - Wrong stack? → read `package.json`, don't ask.
   - Wrong audience? → check the `README`, don't ask.
   - Wrong framework? → check config files, don't ask.
4. **Cache the answer.** Write each Q→A pair into the Requirements Document verbatim. If the user restarts the idea session on the same feature, reuse the cached answers — never re-ask what was already answered.
5. **Bundle yes/no questions after Q1 if the user is concise.** A user who replies "y" / "n" / "skip" in 1-2 words tolerates a bundle. A user who replies with paragraphs wants the slow pace — keep one-at-a-time.

Every Q should earn its slot: removing it must leave the Requirements Document materially worse. If it wouldn't, cut the question.

#### Structured Elicitation Frameworks

Choose the framework that fits the requirement type. Use it to STRUCTURE the 5 Questions above, not replace them.

| Framework | When to Use | Structure |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **PICO** | Clinical, research, data-driven, or A/B testing features | **P**opulation (who), **I**ntervention (what change), **C**omparison (vs what), **O**utcome (measurable result) |
| **INVEST** | User stories for sprint-sized features | **I**ndependent, **N**egotiable, **V**aluable, **E**stimable, **S**mall, **T**estable |
| **Jobs-to-be-Done** | Product features, user workflows | "When [situation], I want to [motivation] so I can [expected outcome]" |


**PICO Example (data feature):**
```
P: Dashboard users monitoring real-time metrics
I: Add anomaly detection alerts
C: vs. current manual threshold setting
O: 30% faster incident detection (measurable KPI)
```

**When to apply which:**
- Feature Request → INVEST (ensures stories are sprint-ready)
- Data/Analytics/Research feature → PICO (forces measurable outcome definition)
- Product/UX feature → Jobs-to-be-Done (keeps focus on user motivation)
- Integration → 5 Questions only (frameworks add noise for plumbing tasks)

### Step 2.5 — Ambiguity Scoring (Execution Gate)

After each question round, compute an **Ambiguity Score** to determine if requirements are clear enough to proceed. This prevents premature handoff to `plan` with vague inputs.

#### Scoring Formula

```
Ambiguity = 1 - weighted_average(dimensions)

Dimensions (weights vary by requirement type):
  Greenfield:  Goal (40%) + Constraints (30%) + Success Criteria (30%)
  Feature:     Goal (30%) + Constraints (30%) + Success Criteria (20%) + Integration (20%)
  Integration: Goal (20%) + Constraints (25%) + Success Criteria (20%) + API Contract (35%)
```

#### Dimension Scoring (0.0 – 1.0)

| Dimension | 0.0 (Unknown) | 0.5 (Partial) | 1.0 (Clear) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Goal** | "Make it better" | "Improve dashboard performance" | "Dashboard loads in <2s with 10k rows" |
| **Constraints** | No constraints mentioned | "Use existing DB" | "PostgreSQL 15, no new deps, GDPR compliant" |
| **Success Criteria** | "It should work" | "Users can see their data" | "AC-1.1: GIVEN 10k rows WHEN page loads THEN render <2s" |
| **Integration** | "Connect to the API" | "Use REST, need auth" | "POST /api/v2/orders, OAuth2, rate limit 100/min" |
| **API Contract** | "It sends data somewhere" | "JSON payload to endpoint" | "OpenAPI spec provided, request/response schemas defined" |

#### Threshold Gate

| Ambiguity | Level | Action |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **< 15%** | Crystal Clear | Proceed to Step 3 immediately |
| **15-25%** | Acceptable | Proceed with noted assumptions — flag gaps in Requirements Doc |
| **25-40%** | Unclear | Ask 1-2 targeted follow-up questions on weakest dimension |
| **> 40%** | Blocked | Do NOT proceed. Re-ask the weakest dimension question with examples |

<HARD-GATE>
NEVER hand off to plan with Ambiguity > 40%.
If user insists "just build it" at > 40%, respond:
"Ambiguity is [X]% — the weakest area is [dimension]. One more answer cuts this in half: [targeted question]"
</HARD-GATE>

#### Scoring After Each Question

After each of the 5 Questions (Step 2), update the score:

```
Round 1 (WHO):    Goal ≈ 0.3, others = 0.0 → Ambiguity ≈ 91%
Round 2 (WHAT):   Goal ≈ 0.7, Success ≈ 0.3 → Ambiguity ≈ 72%
Round 3 (WHY):    Goal ≈ 0.9, Success ≈ 0.5 → Ambiguity ≈ 47%
Round 4 (BOUNDS): Constraints ≈ 0.6 → Ambiguity ≈ 30%
Round 5 (CONSTR): Constraints ≈ 0.9 → Ambiguity ≈ 12% ✅
```

If Ambiguity drops below 15% before all 5 questions are asked (e.g., user provides a detailed PRD), skip remaining questions and proceed. The gate is about clarity, not ceremony.

#### Display Format

After completing Step 2, show the user:

```
Clarity Score: [100 - ambiguity]%
  Goal:             [██████████] 0.9
  Constraints:      [████████░░] 0.8
  Success Criteria: [██████░░░░] 0.6  ← weakest
  Status: ACCEPTABLE (ambiguity 23%) — proceeding with noted gaps
```

### Step 2.6 — CONTEXT.md Cross-Reference Gate

After elicitation, before hidden-requirement discovery, scan the user's answers for assertions about *current behavior* — phrasings like "the system X", "the code does X", "we already X", "right now it X".

For each such assertion:

1. `Grep` the codebase for evidence (function names, route handlers, schema definitions matching the asserted behavior).
2. Compare grep results to the user's claim.

| Outcome | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Grep confirms claim | Proceed; record term in CONTEXT.md if domain-relevant |
| Grep contradicts claim | <HARD-GATE>Surface the conflict immediately. *"You said the system does X, but the code path I see does Y. Which is canonical?"* Pause until resolved.</HARD-GATE> |
| Grep returns nothing | Note as unverified; ask user for the file/function name; do not record in CONTEXT.md until verified |

This gate prevents the agent from silently transcribing user-asserted behavior that contradicts code — a common source of "the docs say X but the code does Y" drift.

### Step 3 — Hidden Requirement Discovery

After the 5 questions, analyze for requirements the user DIDN'T mention:

**Technical hidden requirements:**
- Authentication/authorization needed?
- Rate limiting needed?
- Data persistence needed? (what DB, what schema)
- Error handling strategy?
- Offline/fallback behavior?
- Mobile responsiveness?
- Accessibility requirements?
- Internationalization?

**Business hidden requirements:**
- What happens on failure? (graceful degradation)
- What data needs to be tracked? (analytics events)
- Who else is affected? (other teams, other systems)
- What are the edge cases? (empty state, max limits, concurrent access)
- Regulatory/compliance needs? (GDPR, PCI, HIPAA)

Present discovered hidden requirements to user: "I found N additional requirements you may not have considered: [list]. Which are relevant?"

### Step 3.5 — Completeness Scoring (Options & Alternatives)

When presenting options, alternatives, or scope decisions to the user, rate each with a **Completeness score (X/10)**:

| Score | Meaning | Guidance |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 9-10 | Complete — all edge cases, full coverage, production-ready | Always recommend |
| 7-8 | Covers happy path, skips some edges | Acceptable for MVP |
| 4-6 | Shortcut — defers significant work to later | Flag trade-off explicitly |
| 1-3 | Minimal viable, technical debt guaranteed | Only for time-critical emergencies |

**Always recommend the higher-completeness option** unless the delta is truly expensive. With AI-assisted coding, the marginal cost of completeness is near-zero:

| Task Type | Human Team | AI-Assisted | Compression |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Boilerplate / scaffolding | 2 days | 15 min | ~100x |
| Test writing | 1 day | 15 min | ~50x |
| Feature implementation | 1 week | 30 min | ~30x |
| Bug fix + regression test | 4 hours | 15 min | ~20x |

**When showing effort estimates**, always show both scales: `(human: ~X / AI: ~Y)`. The compression ratio reframes "too expensive" into "15 minutes more."

**Anti-pattern**: "Choose B — it covers 90% of the value with less code." → If A is only 70 lines more, choose A. The last 10% is where production bugs hide.


### Step 3.6 — Logic Consistency Check

After ambiguity + completeness pass, scan for **cross-dimension contradictions**. Ambiguity measures CLARITY of each dimension in isolation; this step measures CONSISTENCY across dimensions. A perfectly clear requirement can still contradict itself.

#### Checks

Run each, label verdict 🟢 pass / 🟡 warn / 🔴 fail:

| # | Check | 🔴 Fail | 🟢 Pass |
|---|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Every Acceptance Criterion traces to a User Story | AC orphaned | 1:N mapping clear |
| 2 | Every Business Rule (Q5) is enforced in an AC or Exception Flow | Rule has no enforcement path | Rule → specific AC or exception |
| 3 | Scope IN ∩ Scope OUT = ∅ | Direct overlap in phrasing | Sets disjoint |
| 4 | Every user-story flow has a terminal state | State loop without exit condition | Terminal state explicit |
| 5 | Dependencies (Step 4) ⊂ Constraints acknowledged (Q5) | Dependency never mentioned in constraints | All deps covered |
| 6 | NFRs measurable against at least one AC | NFR has no test hook | Every NFR → testable AC |
| 7 | Hidden requirements (Step 3) resolved in/out | Silent inclusion | User confirmed inclusion or exclusion |
| 0 | Prior rejection check (Step 1.5) — exact-match resolved with explicit override or session ended | Silent re-litigation of rejected concept | User chose: override (priority bumped) OR accept prior decision (session ends) |

#### Output Format

```
Logic Consistency Report:
  1. AC → User Story:      🟢 all AC trace to US-1 or US-2
  2. Business rule → AC:   🟡 "no duplicate emails" cited — exception flow missing
  3. Scope disjoint:       🟢
  4. Terminal states:      🟢
  5. Deps in constraints:  🔴 "PostgreSQL 15" missing from Q5 answer
  6. NFR measurable:       🟢
  7. Hidden reqs resolved: 🟢

Verdict: 1 🔴, 1 🟡, 5 🟢 → BLOCK handoff until 🔴 fixed
```

#### Gate Rule

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| 0 🔴 | Proceed to Step 4 — 🟡 warnings become "Risks" in Requirements Doc |
| 1-2 🔴 | BLOCK — ask targeted question or re-scope to resolve each 🔴 |
| 3+ 🔴 | Scrap Steps 2-3 and restart — requirements structurally incoherent |

<HARD-GATE>
NEVER hand off to plan with unresolved 🔴. Ambiguity ≤ 40% does not imply consistency — they are orthogonal gates.
If user pushes "just build it" with 🔴 present, respond: "Contradiction in [dimension]: [specific conflict]. One clarification fixes this: [targeted question]"
</HARD-GATE>

### Step 4 — Scope Definition

Based on all gathered information, produce:

**In-Scope** (explicitly included):
- [list of features/behaviors that WILL be built]

**Out-of-Scope** (explicitly excluded):
- [list of things we WON'T build — prevents scope creep]

**Assumptions** (things we're assuming without proof):
- [each assumption is a risk if wrong]

**Dependencies** (things that must exist before we can build):
- [APIs, services, libraries, access, existing code]

### Step 5 — User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

For each in-scope feature, generate:

```
US-1: As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [benefit]
  AC-1.1: GIVEN [context] WHEN [action] THEN [result]
  AC-1.2: GIVEN [error case] WHEN [action] THEN [error handling]
  AC-1.3: GIVEN [edge case] WHEN [action] THEN [graceful behavior]
```

Rules:
- Primary user story first, then edge cases
- Every user story has at least 2 acceptance criteria (happy path + error)
- Acceptance criteria are TESTABLE — they become test cases in Phase 3

### Step 6 — Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

Assess and document ONLY relevant NFRs:

| NFR | Requirement | Measurement |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| Performance | Page load < Xs, API response < Yms | Lighthouse, k6 |
| Security | Auth required, input validation, OWASP top 10 | sentinel scan |
| Scalability | Expected users, data volume | Load test target |
| Reliability | Uptime target, error budget | Monitoring threshold |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.2 AA | Axe audit |

Only include NFRs relevant to this specific task. Don't generate a generic checklist.

### Step 6.5 — Tiered Recommendations

For product-oriented requirements (Feature Request, Integration, Greenfield), generate **tiered strategic recommendations**. This structures the path forward into actionable time horizons.

**Three Tiers:**

| Tier | Timeframe | Focus | Characteristics |
|------|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Quick Win** | 0-30 days | Immediate impact | Low effort, high visibility, builds momentum |
| **Differentiation** | 1-3 months | Competitive edge | Medium effort, unique value, hard to copy |
| **Long-term Moat** | 6-12 months | Sustainable advantage | High effort, defensible, compounds over time |

**For each tier, specify:**

```markdown
### Quick Win (0-30 days)
- **Action**: [Specific deliverable]
- **Resources**: [Team size, tools, dependencies]
- **Expected Impact**: [Measurable outcome]
- **Risk if skipped**: [What happens without this]

### Differentiation (1-3 months)
- **Action**: [...]
- **Resources**: [...]
- **Expected Impact**: [...]
- **Risk if skipped**: [...]

### Long-term Moat (6-12 months)
- **Action**: [...]
- **Resources**: [...]
- **Expected Impact**: [...]
- **Risk if skipped**: [...]
```

**Rules:**
- Quick Win MUST be achievable in first sprint — no dependencies on later tiers
- Differentiation should create switching costs or unique capabilities
- Long-term Moat should compound (network effects, data moats, ecosystem lock-in)
- Every tier includes "Risk if skipped" — makes trade-offs explicit
- Skip this step for Bug Fix and Refactor types (no strategic dimension)

### Step 7 — Artifact Triad

Produce three structured artifacts — not one prose doc. Plan consumes all three; each answers a different question.

| Artifact | Question Answered | Consumer |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| `requirements.md` | WHAT to build and WHY | plan, build |
| `requirements.mermaid` | WHAT does the flow look like visually | plan, design, review |
| `tasks.md` | WHAT work layers exist | plan (as task backbone, not from scratch) |

#### Artifact 1: requirements.md

Structured document combining Steps 1-6.5. Save to `.topia/features/<feature-name>/requirements.md`:

```markdown
# Requirements Document: [Feature Name]
Created: [date] | idea session: [summary]

## Context
[Problem statement — 2-3 sentences]

## Stakeholders
- Primary user: [who]
- Affected systems: [what]

## User Stories
[from Step 5]

## Scope
### In Scope
### Out of Scope
### Assumptions

## Non-Functional Requirements
[from Step 6]

## Dependencies
[from Step 4]

## Risks

## Logic Consistency Report
[from Step 3.6 — verbatim, for audit trail]

```

#### Artifact 2: requirements.mermaid

Auto-generate from User Stories. Save to `.topia/features/<feature-name>/requirements.mermaid`.

**Sequence diagram** (primary happy path from US-1):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  actor User
  participant System
  participant Database
  User->>System: [action from US-1]
  System->>Database: [read/write from AC-1.1]
  Database-->>System: [response]
  System-->>User: [result from AC-1.1]
```

**State machine** (only if any User Story implies state):

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> initial
  initial --> processing: [trigger from AC]
  processing --> success: [happy path AC]
  processing --> failed: [error AC]
  success --> [*]
  failed --> initial: retry
```

Skip state machine if feature is stateless (simple CRUD with no lifecycle). Sequence is always produced.

#### Artifact 3: tasks.md

Pre-broken implementation tasks by layer. Plan refines this backbone, does not create from scratch. Save to `.topia/features/<feature-name>/tasks.md`:

```markdown
# Implementation Tasks: [Feature Name]

## Data Layer
- [ ] Schema — [tables/models from AC]
- [ ] Migration up + down
- [ ] Seed/fixtures if tests need them

## Logic Layer
- [ ] [each Q5 Business Rule → one task]
- [ ] Validation for [each AC error case]
- [ ] State transitions from requirements.mermaid (if present)

## Interface Layer (API / UI)
- [ ] [each User Story → one endpoint or UI component]
- [ ] Contract schema from AC (request/response)
- [ ] Error handling for [each AC error]

## Test Layer
- [ ] Unit: [each business rule → one test]
- [ ] Integration: [each AC happy path]
- [ ] Regression: [each AC error case]

## NFR Verification
- [ ] [each NFR from Step 6 → one measurement task]
```

Derivation rules:
- 1 User Story → ≥1 Interface task
- 1 Business Rule → 1 Logic task + 1 Unit test task
- 1 AC → ≥1 Test task (happy path + error)
- 1 NFR → 1 NFR Verification task

#### Handoff

Emit signal to `plan` with paths to all three artifacts. Plan MUST read all three before producing phase files — the triad is the contract.

### Step 7.5 — Glossary Sharpen (CONTEXT.md update)

After the artifact triad is saved, append/update the project glossary `CONTEXT.md` with any domain terms that were sharpened during this session.

1. Determine glossary location:
   - If `CONTEXT-MAP.md` exists at root → multi-context; pick the right per-context CONTEXT.md
   - Else if root `CONTEXT.md` exists → use it
   - Else if any term needs recording → create root `CONTEXT.md` lazily
   - Else → skip silently (no-op when no terms emerged)
2. For each new term, add a row to the **Language** table (term, definition, aliases-to-avoid, status).
3. For each user-asserted relationship, add to the **Relationships** section.
4. For each ambiguity surfaced during elicitation, add to **Flagged ambiguities**.

**Conflict gate** — if a new term has ≥0.7 token overlap with an existing one, surface to user (merge / rename / keep distinct). NEVER silently re-define an existing term.

Format reference: [references/context-md-format.md](references/context-md-format.md).

### Step 8 — Neural Memory Persistence (SAVE)

Once the user approves the Requirements Document, persist the "Idea Artifact" to `topia:neural-memory`.

1.  **Format Memory**: Create a high-signal summary of the idea, core stakeholders, and key strategic decisions.
2.  **Tag**: Use `[idea, requirements, feature-name]`.
3.  **Persist**: Call `topia:neural-memory` in Capture Mode.
4.  **Emit**: `idea.captured` signal.

## Output Format

Triad of artifacts under `.topia/features/<feature-name>/`:

| File | Template Reference |
|------|-------------------|
| `requirements.md` | Step 7 Artifact 1 |
| `requirements.mermaid` | Step 7 Artifact 2 (sequence + optional state machine) |
| `tasks.md` | Step 7 Artifact 3 (Data / Logic / Interface / Test / NFR layers) |

Inside `requirements.md` the **Decision Classification** table MUST appear verbatim — plan gates on Decision compliance, Discretion items skip approval:

| Category | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Decisions** (locked) | User confirmed — agent MUST follow | "Use PostgreSQL, not MongoDB" |
| **Discretion** (agent decides) | User trusts agent judgment | "Pick the best validation library" |
| **Deferred** (out of scope) | Explicitly NOT this task | "Mobile app — future phase" |

## Constraints

1. MUST ask up to 5 probing questions before producing requirements — never more, skip any you can infer from context
2. MUST prefer yes/no or multiple-choice questions — open-ended only when no reasonable option set exists
3. MUST NOT ask for information already present in the user's message, the repo, or classification — read/grep first, ask second
4. MUST cache each Q→A pair in the Requirements Document and reuse on subsequent idea sessions for the same feature
5. MUST identify hidden requirements — the obvious ones are never the full picture
6. MUST define out-of-scope explicitly — prevents scope creep
7. MUST produce testable acceptance criteria — they become test cases
8. MUST NOT write code or plan implementation — idea produces WHAT, plan produces HOW
9. MUST ask ONE question at a time by default; bundle yes/no batches only after user shows concise replies
10. MUST NOT skip idea for non-trivial tasks — "just build it" gets redirected to Question 1

## Sharp Edges

Known failure modes for this skill. Check these before declaring done.

| Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Skipping questions because "requirements are obvious" | CRITICAL | HARD-GATE: 5 questions mandatory, even for "simple" tasks |
| Answering own questions instead of asking user | HIGH | Questions require USER input — idea doesn't guess |
| Producing implementation details (HOW) instead of requirements (WHAT) | HIGH | idea outputs requirements doc → plan outputs implementation |
| All-at-once question dump (asking 5 questions in one message) | MEDIUM | One question at a time, wait for answer before next |
| Asking open-ended questions when yes/no or multiple-choice would work | HIGH | Question Discipline rule 2 — option sets are faster to answer and easier to cache |
| Asking for info already in the repo/message (stack, framework, audience) | HIGH | Question Discipline rule 3 — read `package.json`/README/config first, ask only what you genuinely can't find |
| Exceeding 5 questions when the user seems "engaged" | MEDIUM | Question Discipline rule 1 — hard cap at 5. A 6th question is a sign of stalling, not thoroughness |
| Re-asking on session restart when answers were cached | MEDIUM | Question Discipline rule 4 — load `.topia/features/<name>/requirements.md` and reuse cached Q→A pairs |
| Missing hidden requirements (auth, error handling, edge cases) | HIGH | Step 3 checklist is mandatory scan |
| Requirements doc too verbose (>500 lines) | MEDIUM | Max 200 lines — concise, actionable, testable |
| Skipping idea for "simple" features that turn out complex | HIGH | Let build's complexity detection trigger idea, not user judgment |
| Recommending shortcuts without Completeness Score | MEDIUM | Step 3.5: every option needs X/10 score + dual effort estimate (human vs AI). "90% coverage" is a red flag when 100% costs 15 min more |
| Handing off to plan with ambiguity > 40% | CRITICAL | Step 2.5 HARD-GATE: compute ambiguity score after elicitation, block handoff if > 40%, ask targeted follow-up on weakest dimension |
| Skipping ambiguity scoring because "user seems clear" | HIGH | Always compute the score — perceived clarity ≠ measured clarity. The formula catches gaps humans miss |
| Tiered recommendations too vague ("improve things") | MEDIUM | Each tier needs specific Action + measurable Expected Impact. "Build better UX" → "Reduce checkout steps from 5 to 3, targeting 15% conversion lift" |
| All three tiers have same resources/effort | MEDIUM | Quick Win should be low-effort. If all tiers need "2 engineers, 3 months" → re-scope Quick Win to something achievable in 1 sprint |
| Skipping Logic Consistency check because ambiguity is low | CRITICAL | Step 3.6 HARD-GATE: clarity ≠ consistency. A 90% clarity spec can still contain pairwise contradictions (scope IN/OUT overlap, rules with no enforcement, orphan ACs) |
| Handing off to plan with unresolved 🔴 consistency fails | CRITICAL | Step 3.6 gate: 1+ 🔴 = BLOCK. 🟡 allowed only when logged as Risk in requirements.md |
| Producing only requirements.md, skipping mermaid and tasks.md | HIGH | Step 7 is a triad — plan's contract expects all 3. Sequence diagram is always produced; state machine only if stateful; tasks.md always produced |
| Mermaid diagram unrelated to actual user stories (decorative only) | MEDIUM | Sequence must trace AC-1.1 of US-1; state machine nodes must map to state-bearing ACs. Auditable by pattern-match |
| tasks.md as flat list instead of layered | MEDIUM | Derivation rules enforce 1 US → Interface task, 1 rule → Logic + Unit test, 1 AC → Test task, 1 NFR → verification. Skipping layers loses plan's backbone structure |
| Re-litigating a previously rejected concept without surfacing it | HIGH | Step 1.5 HARD-GATE: scan `.out-of-scope/` first; exact match (≥0.8) MUST be surfaced before elicitation begins |
| Skipping Step 1.5 because `.out-of-scope/` directory looks empty | MEDIUM | Empty directory is silent-skip OK; directory absent entirely is silent-skip OK; never skip due to "I don't think this matches anything" — let the matcher decide |
| User asserts behavior; agent records user's version without grep verification | HIGH | Step 2.6 HARD-GATE: every "the system does X" assertion gets grep'd; conflicts surface to user before recording |
| Silently re-defining an existing CONTEXT.md term | HIGH | Step 7.5 conflict gate: ≥0.7 overlap → user chooses merge/rename/keep-distinct |
| Auto-creating an empty CONTEXT.md when no terms emerged | LOW | Lazy creation rule: only write when there's a non-trivial term to record |
| Mid-elicitation rejection ("scrap it") that ends the session without writing `.out-of-scope/` | CRITICAL | Step 1.6 HARD-GATE: explicit rejection MUST produce `.out-of-scope/<slug>.md` before session end — oral rejections vanish, force re-litigation next session |
| Writing `.out-of-scope/` for a deferral instead of routing to backlog | MEDIUM | Step 1.6 procedure step 1: confirm "out of scope" vs "deferred" — temporary reasons go to backlog, not the rejection KB |
| Running 5-question elicitation when conversation already contains rich context | HIGH | Step 1.4: synthesis-trigger check fires before Step 2 — pasted spec / >1000 words / continuation / explicit "synthesize" → switch to Synthesis Mode (extract + cite + confirm), don't re-interview |
| Synthesizing requirements without source citations | HIGH | Synthesis Mode requires citing source for every dimension (user message N, pasted doc, continuation file). User cannot verify interpretation without citations |
| Auto-handoff to plan after synthesis without explicit user "go"/"locked" confirmation | HIGH | Synthesis is interpretation, not transcription. Without explicit confirmation, drift becomes a downstream bug |
| Asking inferable questions ("what stack are you using?") without first checking package.json | HIGH | Step 2.0 HARD-GATE — every question requires prior tool-call evidence (Read/Glob/Grep) or explicit unavailability declaration |
| Re-asking a question already answered earlier in the conversation | MEDIUM | Step 2.0 check 4 — cache and reuse, never re-ask |

## Cost Profile

~3000-6000 tokens input, ~1500-3000 tokens output. Opus for deep requirement analysis — understanding WHAT to build is the most expensive mistake to get wrong.
