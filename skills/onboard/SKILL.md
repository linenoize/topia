# onboard

## Purpose

Auto-generate project context for AI sessions. Scans the codebase and creates a CLAUDE.md project config plus .topia/ state directory so every future session starts with full context. Saves 10-20 minutes of re-explaining per session on undocumented projects.

## Triggers

- `/topia onboard` — manual invocation on any project
- Called by `rescue` as Phase 0 (understand before refactoring)
- Auto-trigger: when no CLAUDE.md exists in project root

## Calls (outbound)

- `recon` (L2): deep codebase scan — structure, frameworks, patterns, dependencies
- `guardian-env` (L3): validate developer environment (runtime versions, required tools, env vars) so the onboarded project is actually runnable
- `autopsy` (L2): when project appears messy or undocumented — health assessment

## Called By (inbound)

- User: `/topia onboard` manual invocation
- `rescue` (L1): Phase 0 — understand legacy project before refactoring
- `build` (L1): if no CLAUDE.md found, onboard first

## Executable Steps

### Step 1 — Full Scan
Invoke `Topia:recon` on the project root. Collect:
- Top-level directory structure (depth 2)
- All config files: `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `composer.json`, `.nvmrc`, `.python-version`, `Pipfile.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`
- Python environment markers: `.venv/`, `venv/`, `conda-meta/`, `.python-version`
- Entry point files: `main.*`, `index.*`, `app.*`, `server.*`
- Test directory names and test file patterns
- CI/CD config files: `.github/workflows/`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`
- README.md if present

Do not read every source file — scout gives the skeleton. Use `Read` only on config files and entry points.

### Step 2 — Detect Tech Stack
From the scan output, determine with confidence:
- **Language**: TypeScript | JavaScript | Python | Rust | Go | other
- **Framework**: Next.js | Vite+React | SvelteKit | Express | FastAPI | Django | none | other
- **Package manager**: npm | pnpm | yarn | pip | poetry | cargo | go modules
- **Test framework**: Vitest | Jest | pytest | cargo test | go test | none
- **Build tool**: tsc | vite | webpack | esbuild | cargo | none
- **Linter/formatter**: ESLint | Biome | Ruff | Black | Clippy | none
- **Python environment** (if Python project): detect from project markers:
  - `.venv/` or `venv/` directory → venv
  - `poetry.lock` → poetry
  - `uv.lock` → uv
  - `.python-version` → pyenv
  - `conda-meta/` or `environment.yml` → conda
  - `Pipfile.lock` → pipenv
  - None found → none (note: recommend setting up a virtual environment)

If a field cannot be determined with confidence, write "unknown" — do not guess.

### Step 3 — Extract Conventions
Read 3–5 representative source files (pick files with the most connections in the project — typically the main module, a route/controller file, and a utility file). Extract:
- **Naming patterns**: camelCase | snake_case | PascalCase for files, functions, variables
- **Import style**: named imports | default imports | barrel files (index.ts)
- **Error handling pattern**: try/catch | Result type | error boundary | unhandled
- **State management**: React Context | Zustand | Redux | Svelte stores | none
- **API pattern**: REST | tRPC | GraphQL | SDK | none
- **Test structure**: co-located (`file.test.ts`) | separate directory (`tests/`) | none

Write extracted conventions as bullet points — be specific, not generic.

### Step 4 — Generate CLAUDE.md
Use `Write` to create `CLAUDE.md` at the project root. Populate every section using data from Steps 2–3. Do not leave template placeholders — if data is unknown, write "unknown" or omit the section. Use the template below as the exact structure.

If a `CLAUDE.md` already exists, use `Read` to load it first, then merge — preserve any human-written sections (comments starting with `<!-- manual -->`) and update auto-detected sections only.

### Step 5.6 — Ensure .gitignore (before writing .topia/)

Run **before** Step 5 creates session files:

```bash
node skills/onboard/scripts/ensure-gitignore.js --root <project-root>
```

- Interactive: prompts once `Add standard ignore rules to .gitignore? [Y/n]`
- Non-interactive: `--yes` auto-appends; decline writes `.topia/skip-gitignore.flag`
- Record outcome in the Onboard Report under `### Gitignore`

### Step 5 — Initialize .topia/ Directory
Use `Bash` to create the directory: `mkdir -p .topia`

Use `Write` to create each file:
- `.topia/conventions.md` — paste the extracted conventions from Step 3 in full detail
- `.topia/decisions.md` — create with header `# Architecture Decisions` and one placeholder row in a markdown table (Date | Decision | Rationale | Status)
- `.topia/progress.md` — create with header `# Progress Log` and one placeholder entry
- `.topia/session-log.md` — create with header `# Session Log` and current date as first entry
- `.topia/instincts.md` — create with header `# Project Instincts` and a description: "Learned trigger→action patterns. Managed by session-bridge. See session-bridge SKILL.md Step 5.7 for format."
- `.topia/contract.md` — generate a starter contract based on the detected tech stack:
  - Copy structure from `docs/CONTRACT-TEMPLATE.md`
  - Customize rules based on Step 2 findings (e.g., Python → add `no bare except`, Node.js → add `no console.log`, SQL database → add parameterized queries rule)
  - Remove sections that don't apply (e.g., `contract.operations` for a library with no deployed service)
  - The contract is a starting point — tell the user to review and customize it

### Step 5.4 — Detect Invariants (Auto-Discipline Seed)

Scan the project for rules that span files — the kind of mistake a linter cannot catch but a single agent edit can introduce. The goal is to seed `.topia/INVARIANTS.md` with ≥3 plausible rules so `logic-guardian` has something to enforce on day one.

Invoke the scanner directly:

```bash
node skills/onboard/scripts/onboard-invariants.js --root <project-root>
```

What it produces:
- `.topia/INVARIANTS.md` — rendered from `skills/onboard/references/invariants-template.md` plus auto-detected rules in four buckets:
  - **Danger Zones** — directories with the most cross-file references
  - **Critical Invariants** — shared constants exported and imported in ≥3 places
  - **State Machine Rules** — reducer/switch shapes with state literal pairs
  - **Cross-File Consistency** — literal tuples mirrored across ≥3 files
- `CLAUDE.md` — adds two auto-generated pointer blocks:
  - **Invariants** (`<!-- @Topia-invariants-pointer:start -->` … `end`) — top danger-zone globs; links to `.topia/INVARIANTS.md`.
  - **Context** (`<!-- @Topia-context-pointer:start -->` … `end`) — inventory of `.topia/` session files (`decisions.md`, `plan-*.md`, `adr/`, etc.) so agents know persisted state exists beyond invariants.
- Skip directives: `<!-- @Topia-invariants-pointer:skip -->` or `<!-- @Topia-context-pointer:skip -->` in `CLAUDE.md` prevents re-injection of that block.

Merge rules (safe re-runs):
- If `.topia/INVARIANTS.md` exists, user edits above `## Auto-detected (new)` are **never** overwritten.
- New detections replace **only** the content under `## Auto-detected (new)`.
- If a user sets a skip directive for either pointer block in `CLAUDE.md`, that block is not re-injected.

Emit signal `invariants.seeded` with `{danger_count, critical_count, state_count, cross_count}` when done. `session-bridge` listens in Phase 3 to surface the loudest rules at session start.

**Do not fabricate rules.** If detection yields zero results, write `_No new detections on this run._` under `## Auto-detected (new)` and move on. A quiet INVARIANTS.md is better than fake rules the user has to ptopia.

### Step 5.5 — Load Existing Instincts

If `.topia/instincts.md` already exists and contains instinct entries, read it and include a summary in the Onboard Report under `### Learned Instincts`. This tells the agent what project-specific behaviors have been learned from previous sessions.

For each instinct with confidence ≥0.6, include in the report:
- Trigger and action (one line)
- Confidence level

Instincts with confidence <0.6 are still learning — mention count but don't list individually.

**Why**: Onboard is the first skill that runs in a new session. Surfacing instincts here ensures the agent starts with project-specific learned behaviors, not just static conventions.

### Step 6b — Generate DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md

Use the data from Steps 2–3 to generate `.topia/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` — a human-readable onboarding guide for new team members joining the project. This is NOT AI context — it is clear prose for humans.

Use `Write` to create `.topia/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` with this template:

```markdown
# Developer Guide: [Project Name]

## What This Does
[2 sentences max. What problem does this project solve? Who uses it?]

## Quick Setup
[Copy-paste commands to get from zero to running locally]
```bash
# [Python projects] Activate virtual environment
[detected activation command — e.g., source .venv/bin/activate | poetry shell | uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate]

# Install dependencies
[detected command — e.g., pip install -e ".[dev]" | poetry install | npm install]

# Run development server
[detected command]

# Run tests
[detected command]
```

## Key Files
[5–10 most important files with one-line description each]
- `[path]` — [what it does]

## How to Contribute
1. Fork or branch from main
2. Make changes, run tests: `[test command]`
3. Open a PR — describe what and why

## Common Issues
[Top 3 "it doesn't work" situations with fixes. Only include issues you can infer from the codebase — e.g., missing .env, wrong Node version, database not running]

[Python projects — always include these if applicable:]
- **ModuleNotFoundError** → Virtual environment not activated. Run: `[activation command]`
- **ImportError: cannot import name X** → Dependencies outdated. Run: `[install command]`
- **PYTHONPATH issues** → If using src layout, install in editable mode: `pip install -e .`

## Who to Ask
[If git log reveals consistent contributors, list them. Otherwise omit this section.]
```

If `.topia/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` already exists, skip and log **INFO**: "Skipped existing .topia/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md — manual content preserved."

### Step 6c — Activate L4 Extension Packs

Based on the detected tech stack from Step 2, **activate** (not merely suggest) matching L4 packs. Packs are already shipped with the Topia plugin — this step records project preferences for routing.

| Detected Stack | Suggest Pack | Why |
|----------------|-------------|-----|
| React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, SvelteKit | `@Topia/ui` | Frontend component patterns, design system, accessibility audit |
| Express, Fastify, FastAPI, Django, NestJS, Go HTTP | `@Topia/backend` | API patterns, auth flows, middleware, rate limiting |
| Docker, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD config | `@Topia/devops` | Container patterns, deployment pipelines, infrastructure as code |
| React Native, Expo, Flutter, SwiftUI | `@Topia/mobile` | Mobile architecture, navigation patterns, offline sync |
| Security-focused codebase (auth, payments, HIPAA/PCI markers) | `@Topia/security` | Threat modeling, OWASP flows, compliance patterns |
| Trading, finance, pricing, portfolio, market data | | Market data validation, risk calculation, backtesting patterns |
| Subscription billing, tenant isolation, feature flags | | Multi-tenancy, billing integration, feature flag patterns |
| Cart, checkout, product catalog, inventory, payments | `@Topia/ecommerce` | Cart patterns, payment flows, inventory management |
| ML models, training pipelines, embeddings, LLM integration | `@Topia/ai-ml` | Model evaluation, prompt patterns, inference optimization |
| Game loop, physics, entity systems, multiplayer | | Game architecture, ECS patterns, netcode |
| CMS, blog, newsletter, SEO, content workflows | `@Topia/content` | Content modeling, SEO patterns, editorial workflows |
| Analytics, dashboards, metrics, data pipelines, BI | `@Topia/analytics` | Data modeling, visualization patterns, pipeline architecture |

If 0 packs match: omit this section from the report (no suggestions is correct for a generic project).

**Community pack discovery**: Also check if `.topia/community-packs/registry.json` exists. If it does, list installed community packs alongside core pack suggestions. If community packs are installed, include them under a `### Installed Community Packs` subsection.

If ≥1 packs match:

1. Run:
```bash
node skills/onboard/scripts/detect-l4-packs.js --root <project-root> --framework "<framework>" --language "<language>" --signals "<extra signals>"
```
2. Merge `claudeSection` from JSON output into `CLAUDE.md` under `## Topia — Active L4 packs`
3. If `topia.config.json` exists, script updates `extensions.enabled` — tell user to run `topia build`
4. Report under `### Active L4 Packs` (not "Suggested") — list packs written to `.topia/active-packs.json`

### Step 6d — Context Budget Check (interactive)

Audit baseline context cost. When high, **ask the user which remediations to apply** (including **All**).

1. Run audit:
```bash
node skills/onboard/scripts/context-budget.js --root <project-root> --audit --mcp-tools <count> --claude-lines <n>
```
2. If JSON `advisory: true`, use the **AskQuestion** tool:
   - Title: `Context budget`
   - Prompt: **"Context budget is high. Which would you like to do?"**
   - `allow_multiple: true`
   - Options: each entry in `askQuestionSpec.choices` (includes `all` → **All of the above**)
3. Map answers to apply:
   - If user selected `all` (alone or with others): `--apply all`
   - Else: `--apply slim-claude-md,pointer-block` (comma-separated ids)
```bash
node skills/onboard/scripts/context-budget.js --root <project-root> --apply <ids>
```
4. Report `### Context Budget` with metrics + `chosen` / `applied` from `.topia/context-budget.json`

**Skip AskQuestion if**: `advisory: false` (MCP ≤80 and CLAUDE.md ≤150 lines).

### Step 6e — AI-Driven Interview (Optional, User-Initiated)

When invoked as `/topia onboard --interview` or when the project is too ambiguous for automated detection (e.g., no package.json, no clear entry point, mixed languages), switch to **conversational onboarding** — the AI asks targeted questions instead of relying solely on file scanning.

#### Interview Flow

Ask 5-8 questions in sequence, adapting based on answers. Start broad, narrow based on responses:

```
Q1: "What does this project do in one sentence?"
    → Captures purpose (README may be missing or outdated)

Q2: "Who uses this — internal team, external users, or both?"
    → Determines audience, affects DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md tone

Q3: "What's the main entry point — where does execution start?"
    → Bypasses file scanning for complex monorepos

Q4: "What commands do you use daily? (dev server, tests, build)"
    → Gets verified commands instead of guessing from config files

Q5: "Any areas of the codebase you'd warn a new developer about?"
    → Captures tribal knowledge that no scan can detect

Q6: "Are there external services this depends on? (databases, APIs, queues)"
    → Maps integration points for Architecture Map

Q7: "What's the deployment story — how does code get to production?"
    → Captures CI/CD context

Q8 (conditional): "Anything else a new session should know that's not in the code?"
    → Catches edge cases, workarounds, known issues
```

#### Interview Rules

- **Adapt**: Skip questions that were already answered by earlier responses. If Q1 reveals "it's a Next.js app", don't ask about the framework.
- **Validate**: Cross-reference answers with actual file scan results. If user says "we use Jest" but `vitest.config.ts` exists, ask to clarify.
- **Merge**: Interview answers supplement (not replace) automated scan. Scan provides facts, interview provides context and intent.
- **Store**: Save interview responses as high-confidence entries in `.topia/conventions.md` and `.topia/cumulative-notes.md` (tagged `[from-interview]`)

#### When to Auto-Suggest Interview

Suggest switching to interview mode (but don't force it) when:
- Step 2 produces 3+ "unknown" fields in tech stack detection
- Project has no README.md and no package.json/pyproject.toml/Cargo.toml
- Project appears to be a monorepo with 3+ distinct sub-projects

Output: `"ℹ️ This project is hard to auto-detect. Run /topia onboard --interview for guided setup."`

### Step 7 — Commit
Use `Bash` to stage and commit only committable Topia files (not all of `.topia/`):
```bash
git add CLAUDE.md
git add .topia/org/ 2>/dev/null || true
git commit -m "chore: initialize Topia project context"
```

If `git` is not available or the directory is not a git repo, skip this step and add an INFO note to the report: "Not a git repository — files written but not committed."

If any of the `.topia/` files already exist, do not overwrite them (they may contain human-written decisions). Log **INFO**: "Skipped existing .topia/[file] — manual content preserved."

## Constraints

1. MUST scan actual project files — never generate CLAUDE.md from assumptions
2. MUST detect and respect existing CLAUDE.md content — merge, don't overwrite
3. MUST include: build commands, test commands, lint commands, project structure
4. MUST NOT include obvious/generic advice ("write clean code", "use meaningful names")
5. MUST verify generated commands actually work by running them
6. MUST NOT overwrite existing .topia/ files — always preserve human-written content

## Sharp Edges

Known failure modes for this skill. Check these before declaring done.

| Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| CLAUDE.md generated from README alone (no file scan) | CRITICAL | Step 1 MUST invoke scout — never skip actual file scanning |
| DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md contains generic placeholder text not derived from project | HIGH | Every section must reference actual detected commands, files, and patterns — no generic advice |
| Overwriting existing .topia/ files with manual content | CRITICAL | Check file existence before every Write — skip and log INFO if exists |
| Common Issues section fabricated (no actual issues detected) | MEDIUM | Only list issues inferable from codebase (missing .env, Node version, etc.) — omit section if none found |

## Done When

- CLAUDE.md written (or merged) with all detected tech stack fields populated
- .topia/ directory initialized with conventions, decisions, progress, session-log, instincts
- .topia/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md written with setup commands from actual scan
- All generated commands verified to exist in package.json/Makefile/etc.
- Onboard Report emitted with Generated + Skipped + Observations sections

## Returns

| Artifact | Format | Location |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Project AI config | Markdown | `CLAUDE.md` (project root) |
| Detected conventions | Markdown | `.topia/conventions.md` |
| Decision log (initialized) | Markdown | `.topia/decisions.md` |
| Developer onboarding guide | Markdown | `.topia/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` |
| Session/progress files | Markdown | `.topia/progress.md`, `.topia/session-log.md` |

## Cost Profile

~2000-5000 tokens input, ~1000-2000 tokens output. Sonnet for analysis quality.

**Scope guardrail:** onboard generates project context files — it does not modify source code, install dependencies, or change project configuration.
