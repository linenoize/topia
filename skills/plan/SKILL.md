# plan

## Purpose

Strategic planning engine for the Topia ecosystem. Produces a **master plan + phase files** architecture — NOT a single monolithic plan. The master plan is a concise overview (<80 lines) that references separate phase files, each containing enough detail (<150 lines) that ANY model can execute with high accuracy.

**Design principle: Plan for the weakest coder.** Phase files are designed so that even an Amateur-level model (Haiku) can execute them with minimal errors. When the plan satisfies the Amateur's needs, every model benefits — Junior (Sonnet) executes near-perfectly, Senior (Opus) executes flawlessly.

This is enterprise-grade project management: idea produces WHAT → Plan produces HOW (structured into phases) → ANY coder executes each phase with full context.

<HARD-GATE>
NEVER produce a single monolithic plan file for non-trivial tasks.
Non-trivial = 3+ phases OR 5+ files OR estimated > 100 LOC total change.
For non-trivial tasks: MUST produce master plan + separate phase files.
For trivial tasks (1-2 phases, < 5 files): inline plan is acceptable.
</HARD-GATE>

## Architecture: Master Plan + Phase Files

```
.topia/
  plan-<feature>.md          ← Master plan: phases overview, goals, status tracker (<80 lines)
  plan-<feature>-phase1.md   ← Phase 1 detail: tasks, acceptance criteria, files to touch (<150 lines)
  plan-<feature>-phase2.md   ← Phase 2 detail
  ...
```

### Why This Architecture

- **Big context = even Opus misses details and makes mistakes**
- **Small context = Sonnet handles correctly, Opus has zero mistakes**
- Phase isolation prevents cross-contamination of concerns
- Each session starts clean with only the relevant phase loaded
- Coder (Sonnet/Haiku) can execute a phase file without needing the full plan

### Size Constraints

| File | Max Lines | Content |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Master plan | 80 lines | Overview, phase table, key decisions, status |
| Phase file | 200 lines | Amateur-proof template: data flow, contracts, tasks, failures, NFRs, rejections, cross-phase |
| Total phases | Max 8 | If > 8 phases, split into sub-projects |

## Modes

### Implementation Mode (default)
Standard implementation planning — decompose task into phased steps with code details.

### Feature Spec Mode
Product-oriented planning — write a feature specification before implementation.
**Triggers:** user says "spec", "feature spec", "write spec", "PRD" — or `/topia plan spec <feature>`

### Roadmap Mode
High-level multi-feature planning — organize features into milestones.
**Triggers:** user says "roadmap", "milestone", "release plan", "what to build next" — or `/topia plan roadmap`

## Triggers

- Called by `build` when task scope > 1 file (Implementation Mode)
- Called by `team` for high-level task decomposition
- `/topia plan <task>` — manual planning
- `/topia plan spec <feature>` — feature specification
- `/topia plan roadmap` — roadmap planning
- Auto-trigger: when user says "implement", "build", "create" with complex scope

## Calls (outbound)

- `scout` (L2): scan codebase for existing patterns, conventions, and structure
- `brainstorm` (L2): when multiple valid approaches exist
- `adversary` (L2): optional red-team gate on critical plan output (features touching auth, payments, or data integrity)
- `research` (L3): external knowledge lookup
- `sequential-thinking` (L3): complex architecture with many trade-offs
- L4 extension packs: domain-specific architecture patterns
- `neural-memory` | Before architecture decisions | Recall past decisions on similar problems

## Called By (inbound)

- `build` (L1): Phase 2 PLAN
- `team` (L1): task decomposition into parallel workstreams
- `brainstorm` (L2): when idea needs structuring
- `rescue` (L1): plan refactoring strategy
- `idea` (L2): hand-off after requirements complete
- `scaffold` (L1): Phase 3 architecture planning
- `skill-forge` (L2): plan structure for new skill
- User: `/topia plan` direct invocation
- `debug` (L2): when root cause requires architectural changes
- `retro` (L2): reference past plans during retrospective analysis

## Data Flow

### Feeds Into →

- `build` (L1): master plan + phase files → build's Phase 2-4 execution roadmap
- `team` (L1): task decomposition + wave grouping → team's parallel workstream dispatch
- `fix` (L2): phase file tasks → fix's implementation targets
- `test` (L2): phase file test tasks → test's RED phase targets

### Fed By ←

- `idea` (L2): Requirements Document → plan's primary input (locked decisions, user stories)
- `scout` (L2): codebase analysis → plan's convention/pattern awareness
- `neural-memory` (external): past architectural decisions → plan's precedent context
- `sentinel` (L2): repeated security blocks → plan's constraint awareness for future features

### Feedback Loops ↻

- `plan` ↔ `brainstorm`: plan requests options when multiple approaches exist → brainstorm generates options → plan selects and structures the chosen approach
- `plan` ↔ `build`: build discovers plan gaps during implementation → plan updates phase files → build resumes with corrected tasks

## Executable Steps (Implementation Mode)

### Step 1 — Gather Context

Check for `.topia/features/*/requirements.md` via `Glob`. If a Requirements Document exists (from `Topia:idea`), read it — it contains user stories, acceptance criteria, scope, constraints. Do NOT re-gather what idea already elicited.

If `project.onboarded` signal was received, scout output is already available in session context — skip re-invoking scout.

Invoke `Topia:scout` if not already done — plans without context produce wrong file paths. Call `neural-memory` (Recall Mode) to surface past architecture decisions before making new ones.

**Feature Map**: Check for `.topia/features.md` via `Glob`. If it exists, read it — understand the existing feature landscape, dependencies, and known gaps BEFORE planning. Cross-reference: does the new feature overlap, conflict with, or depend on existing features? If `.topia/features.md` does not exist, note this — Step 6.5 will create it.

### Step 2 — Classify Complexity

Determine inline plan vs master + phase files:

| Criteria | Inline Plan | Master + Phase Files |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Phases | 1-2 | 3+ |
| Files touched | < 5 | 5+ |
| Estimated LOC | < 100 | 100+ |
| Cross-module | No | Yes |
| Session span | Single session | Multi-session |

If ANY "Master + Phase Files" criterion is true → produce master plan + phase files.

### Step 3 — Decompose into Phases
<MUST-READ path="references/wave-planning.md" trigger="when writing wave-structured task lists inside any phase"/>
<MUST-READ path="references/vertical-slice.md" trigger="when decomposing a feature into tasks/issues — ALWAYS prefer vertical (end-to-end) slices over horizontal (single-layer) ones"/>

Group work into phases. Each phase: completable in one session, clear "done when", produces testable output, independent enough to run without other phases loaded.

**Vertical slices over horizontal layers**: each task within a phase MUST be a tracer-bullet slice (schema + API + UI + test, end-to-end), NOT a single-layer chunk. Horizontal slicing ("all models → all APIs → all UI") looks organized but blocks on the slowest layer. See `references/vertical-slice.md` for slice rules, AFK vs HITL classification, and the per-task slice template.

<HARD-GATE>
Each phase MUST be completable by ANY coder model (including Haiku) with ONLY the phase file loaded.
If the coder would need to read the master plan or other phase files to execute → the phase file is missing detail.
Phase files are SELF-CONTAINED execution instructions — designed for the weakest model to succeed.
</HARD-GATE>

Phase decomposition rules:
- **Foundation first**: types, schemas, core engine
- **Dependencies before consumers**: create what's imported before the importer
- **Test alongside**: each phase includes its own test tasks
- **Max 5-7 tasks per phase**: if more, split the phase
- **Vertical slices over horizontal layers**: prefer "auth end-to-end" over "all models → all APIs → all UI" (see `references/vertical-slice.md` for tracer-bullet template, AFK/HITL labels, granularity rules)

Tasks within each phase MUST be organized into waves (parallel-safe groupings). See `references/wave-planning.md`.

### Step 4 — Write Master Plan File
<MUST-READ path="references/plan-templates.md" trigger="when writing the master plan file"/>

Save to `.topia/plan-<feature>.md`. Use the Master Plan Template in `references/plan-templates.md`. Max 80 lines — no implementation details.

### Step 4.5 — Workflow Registry (Complex Features Only)
<MUST-READ path="references/workflow-registry.md" trigger="when feature has 4+ phases OR 3+ user-facing workflows"/>

For complex features (4+ phases OR 3+ user-facing workflows): build a 4-view Workflow Registry before writing phase files. Catches orphaned components, unphased workflows, and missing state transitions at plan time.

**Skip** for: trivial tasks, inline plans, single-workflow features.

### Step 5 — Write Phase Files
<MUST-READ path="references/plan-templates.md" trigger="when writing any phase file"/>

For each phase, save to `.topia/plan-<feature>-phase<N>.md`. Use the Amateur-Proof Template in `references/plan-templates.md`.

<HARD-GATE>
Every phase file MUST include ALL of these sections (Amateur-Proof Checklist):
1. ✅ Data Flow — ASCII diagram of how data moves
2. ✅ Code Contracts — function signatures, interfaces, types
3. ✅ Tasks — with file paths, logic description, edge cases
4. ✅ Failure Scenarios — table of when/then/error for each error case
5. ✅ Rejection Criteria — explicit "DO NOT" anti-patterns
6. ✅ Cross-Phase Context — what's assumed from prior phases, what's exported for future phases
7. ✅ Acceptance Criteria — testable, includes performance if applicable
8. ✅ Test tasks — every code task has corresponding tests
9. ✅ Traceability Matrix — every idea requirement mapped to tasks and tests (skip if no idea requirements exist)

A phase missing ANY of sections 1-7 is INCOMPLETE — the weakest coder will guess wrong.
Performance Constraints section is optional (only when NFRs apply).
</HARD-GATE>

### Step 5.5 — Completeness Scoring (Alternatives)
<MUST-READ path="references/completeness-scoring.md" trigger="when presenting alternative approaches"/>

When presenting alternatives (from brainstorm or Step 3), rate each **Completeness X/10**. Always recommend the higher-completeness option — with AI, the marginal cost of completeness is near-zero.

### Step 6 — Present and Get Approval

Present the **master plan** to user (NOT all phase files). User reviews: phase breakdown, key decisions, risks, completeness scores. Wait for explicit approval ("go", "proceed", "yes") before writing phase files.

### Step 6.5 — Update Feature Map (Always)
<MUST-READ path="references/feature-map.md" trigger="every plan invocation"/>

After plan approval, update `.topia/features.md`:

**If `.topia/features.md` does NOT exist** (first run):
1. Reverse-engineer features from scout output — each top-level module = 1 feature
2. Map inter-feature dependencies from imports and shared types
3. Assess status per feature (complete, partial, planned)
4. Generate `.topia/features.md` with Features table, Dependency Graph, Detected Gaps

**If `.topia/features.md` exists** (subsequent runs):
1. Add or update the current feature's row (status, deps, key files)
2. Cross-reference: new feature resolves existing gaps? Creates new ones?
3. Validate dependency graph — flag missing features, orphans, circular deps, dead signals
4. Write updated `.topia/features.md`

**Skip if**: Inline plan for trivial task (no feature-level impact).

### Step 7 — Execution Handoff

```
1. Cook loads master plan → identifies current phase (first ⬚ Pending)
2. Cook loads ONLY that phase's file
3. Coder executes tasks in the phase file
4. Mark tasks done in phase file as completed
5. When phase complete → update master plan status: ⬚ → ✅
6. Next session: load master plan → find next ⬚ phase → load phase file → execute
```

Model selection: Opus plans phases (this skill). Sonnet/Haiku executes them (build → fix).

## Inline Plan (Trivial Tasks)

For trivial tasks (1-2 phases, < 5 files, < 100 LOC) — skip master + phase files. See inline plan template in `references/plan-templates.md`.

## Re-Planning (Dynamic Adaptation)

When build encounters unexpected conditions during execution:

**Trigger Conditions:** Phase hits max debug-fix loops (3) | new files outside plan scope | dependency change | user requests scope change.

**Re-Plan Protocol:**
1. Read master plan + current phase file + delta context (what changed, what failed)
2. Assess impact: which remaining phases are affected?
3. Revise: mark ✅ completed phases, modify affected phase files, add new phases if scope expanded. Do NOT rewrite completed phases.
4. Present revised master plan with diff summary — get approval before resuming.

## Feature Spec Mode

**Step 1** — Problem Statement: what problem, who has it, current workaround?
**Step 2** — User Stories: primary + 2-3 secondary + edge cases. Format: `As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [benefit]`
**Step 3** — Acceptance Criteria: `GIVEN [context] WHEN [action] THEN [result]` — happy path + errors + performance
**Step 4** — Scope Definition: In scope / Out of scope / Dependencies / Open questions
**Step 5** — Write Spec File: save to `.topia/features/<feature-name>/spec.md`

After spec approved → transition to Implementation Mode.

## Roadmap Mode

**Step 1** — Inventory: scan for open issues, TODO/FIXME, planned features.
**Step 2** — Prioritize (ICE Scoring): Impact × Confidence × Ease (each 1-10), sort descending.
**Step 3** — Group into Milestones: M1 = top 3-5 by ICE, M2 = next 3-5, Backlog = remaining.
**Step 4** — Write to `.topia/roadmap.md`.

## Output Format

**Master Plan** (`.topia/plan-<feature>.md`): Overview, Phases table, Key Decisions, Decision Compliance, Architecture, Dependencies/Risks. Max 80 lines. See `references/plan-templates.md`.

**Phase File** (`.topia/plan-<feature>-phase<N>.md`): 7 mandatory sections (Amateur-Proof Template). Max 200 lines. Self-contained. See `references/plan-templates.md`.

**Inline Plan** (trivial tasks): Changes, Tests, Risks. See `references/plan-templates.md`.

## Outcome Block (Mandatory)
<MUST-READ path="references/outcome-block.md" trigger="when writing the final section of any plan output"/>

Every plan output — master plan, phase file, or inline plan — MUST end with an **Outcome Block** containing: What Was Planned + Immediate Next Action (single action, imperative) + How to Measure table (at least one shell command).

## Change Stacking (Overlap Detection)

When producing phase files with wave-based task grouping, every task MUST declare dependency metadata:

```markdown
### Task: Implement auth middleware
- **File**: `src/middleware/auth.ts` — new
- **touches**: [src/middleware/auth.ts, src/types/auth.d.ts]
- **provides**: [AuthMiddleware, verifyToken()]
- **requires**: [UserModel from Wave 1]
- **depends_on**: [task-1a]
```

**Pre-dispatch validation** (run after all tasks written, before presenting plan):

| Check | Detection | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **File overlap** | Same file in `touches[]` of 2+ tasks in same wave | BLOCK — move to sequential waves or merge tasks |
| **Missing dependency** | Task A's `requires[]` not in any prior task's `provides[]` | BLOCK — add missing task or fix dependency chain |
| **Cycle detection** | Task A `depends_on` B, B `depends_on` A | BLOCK — decompose into smaller tasks to break cycle |
| **Orphaned provides** | Task declares `provides[]` but no future task `requires[]` it | WARN — may indicate dead code or missing consumer task |

**Skip if**: Inline plan (trivial task), single-phase plan, or all tasks are strictly sequential.

## Constraints

1. MUST produce master plan + phase files for non-trivial tasks (3+ phases OR 5+ files OR 100+ LOC)
2. MUST keep master plan under 80 lines — overview only, no implementation details
3. MUST keep each phase file under 200 lines — self-contained, Amateur-proof
4. MUST include exact file paths for every task — no vague "set up the database"
5. MUST include test tasks for every phase that produces code
6. MUST include ALL Amateur-Proof sections: data flow, code contracts, tasks, failure scenarios, rejection criteria, cross-phase context, acceptance criteria
7. MUST order phases by dependency — don't plan phase 3 before phase 1's output exists
8. MUST get user approval before writing phase files
9. Phase files MUST be self-contained — coder should NOT need master plan to execute
10. Max 8 phases per master plan — if more, split into sub-projects
11. MUST include failure scenarios table — what happens when things go wrong
12. MUST include rejection criteria — explicit "DO NOT" anti-patterns to prevent common mistakes
13. MUST include cross-phase context — what's assumed from prior phases, what's exported for future
14. MUST update `.topia/features.md` after every non-trivial plan — feature map is a living artifact

## Sharp Edges

| Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Monolithic plan file that overflows context | CRITICAL | HARD-GATE: non-trivial tasks MUST use master + phase files |
| Phase file too vague for Amateur to execute | CRITICAL | Amateur-Proof template: ALL 7 mandatory sections required |
| Coder uses wrong approach (toFixed for money, mutation) | CRITICAL | Rejection Criteria section: explicit "DO NOT" list prevents common traps |
| Coder doesn't handle errors properly | HIGH | Failure Scenarios table: when/then/error for EVERY error case |
| Coder doesn't know what other phases expect | HIGH | Cross-Phase Context: explicit imports/exports between phases |
| Coder over-engineers or under-engineers perf | HIGH | Performance Constraints: specific metrics with thresholds |
| Master plan contains implementation detail | HIGH | Max 80 lines, overview only — detail goes in phase files |
| Phase file references other phase files | HIGH | Phase files are self-contained — cross-phase section handles this |
| Plan without scout context — invented file paths | CRITICAL | Step 1: scout first, always |
| Phase with zero test tasks | CRITICAL | HARD-GATE rejects it |
| 10+ phases overwhelming the master plan | MEDIUM | Max 8 phases — split into sub-projects if more |
| Task without File path or Verify command | HIGH | Every task MUST have File + Test + Verify + Commit fields — no vague "implement the feature" tasks |
| Horizontal layer planning (all models → all APIs → all UI) | HIGH | Vertical slices parallelize better. Use wave-based grouping AND vertical-slice template (`references/vertical-slice.md`): each task = end-to-end path through schema/API/UI/test, demoable on its own |
| Slice not demoable on its own ("just the migration", "just the UI shell") | HIGH | Per `references/vertical-slice.md` — every slice produces a verifiable outcome. Layer-only fragments block downstream slices and hide partial completion |
| HITL slices marked liberally to enable "review" friction | MEDIUM | HITL is for hard blockers (OAuth setup, design decision, paid third-party access), not soft preferences. Default to AFK; use post-merge review for soft signals |
| Tasks without `depends_on` in Wave 2+ | MEDIUM | Implicit dependencies break parallel dispatch. Every Wave 2+ task MUST declare `depends_on` |
| Plan ignores locked Decisions from idea | CRITICAL | Decision Compliance section cross-checks requirements.md — locked decisions are non-negotiable |
| Complex feature missing Workflow Registry — components planned but never wired | HIGH | Step 4.5: 4-view registry catches orphaned components, unphased workflows, and missing state transitions before phase files are written |
| Recommending shortcut approach without Completeness Score | MEDIUM | Step 5.5: every alternative needs X/10 Completeness score + dual effort estimate (human vs AI). "Saves 70 LOC" is not a reason when AI makes the delta cost minutes |
| Plan output missing Outcome Block | MEDIUM | Every plan output MUST end with Outcome Block (What Was Planned + Immediate Next Action + How to Measure) — executor drift when omitted |
| Outcome Block "Next Action" is a list, not one action | LOW | One action only — ambiguity about where to start causes re-analysis and lost context |
| Overlapping file ownership across parallel phases/streams | HIGH | Change Stacking: every task declares `touches[]` — overlap detection flags same file in 2+ tasks before execution |
| Missing dependency between tasks that share artifacts | HIGH | Every task declares `provides[]` and `requires[]` — cycle detection + missing dep check before dispatch |
| New feature planned without checking existing feature map | HIGH | Step 1 reads `.topia/features.md` — catches overlaps, conflicts, and missing dependencies before planning begins |
| Feature map never created — gaps accumulate silently | MEDIUM | Step 6.5 always runs (create or update) — feature map grows organically with each plan invocation |

## Self-Validation

```
SELF-VALIDATION (run before presenting plan to user):
- [ ] Every task has a clear file path — no "update relevant files" vagueness
- [ ] Wave dependencies are acyclic — no task depends on a task in the same or later wave
- [ ] Every code-producing phase has at least one test task
- [ ] Phase files have ALL Amateur-Proof sections (data flow, code contracts, failure scenarios, rejection criteria)
- [ ] Locked decisions from idea are reflected in plan — none contradicted or ignored
- [ ] Every idea requirement has a corresponding Req ID in at least one phase's Traceability Matrix
- [ ] `.topia/features.md` updated with current feature (or created if first run)
- [ ] No cross-feature conflicts detected (or flagged to user if found)
```

- Cross-feature dependencies validated — no conflicts or orphans left unaddressed

## Cost Profile

~3000-8000 tokens input, ~2000-5000 tokens output (master + all phase files). Opus for architectural reasoning. Most expensive L2 skill but runs infrequently. Phase files are written once, executed by cheaper models (Sonnet/Haiku).
