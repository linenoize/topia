# audit

## Purpose

Comprehensive project health audit across 8 dimensions (7 project + 1 nexus analytics). Delegates security scanning to `guardian`, dependency analysis to `dependency-doctor`, and code complexity to `autopsy`, then directly audits architecture, performance, infrastructure, and documentation. Applies framework-specific checks (React/Next.js, Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, React Native/Flutter) based on detected stack. Produces a consolidated health score and prioritized action plan saved to `AUDIT-REPORT.md`.

## Triggers

- `/topia audit` — full 8-dimension project health audit
- `/topia audit dx` — DX Review Mode (Addy Osmani 8 principles, see below)
- User says "audit", "review project", "health check", "project assessment"
- User says "developer experience", "DX audit", "onboarding experience", "time to hello world"

## Calls (outbound)

- `recon` (L2): Phase 0 — project structure and stack discovery
- `dependency-doctor` (L3): Phase 1 — vulnerability scan and outdated dependency check
- `guardian` (L2): Phase 2 — security audit (OWASP Top 10, secrets, config)
- `autopsy` (L2): Phase 3 — code quality and complexity assessment
- `improve-architecture` (L2): Phase 3.5 — architecture sub-score (depth / leverage / locality across top modules)
- `perf` (L2): Phase 4 — performance regression check
- `db` (L2): Phase 5 — database health dimension (schema, migrations, indexes)
- `journal` (L3): record audit date, overall score, and verdict
- `constraint-check` (L3): audit HARD-GATE compliance across project skills
- `sast` (L3): Phase 2 — deep static analysis (Semgrep, Bandit, ESLint security rules)
- `retro` (L2): Phase 6 — engineering velocity and health dimension (topia:retro)
- `browser-pilot` (L3): DX Review Mode — real browser testing of docs, setup guides, error pages

## Called By (inbound)

- `build` (L1): pre-implementation audit gate
- `launch` (L1): pre-launch health check
- User: `/topia audit` direct invocation

## Executable Instructions

### Phase 0: Project Discovery

Call `topia:recon` for a full project map. Then use `Read` on:
- `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.editorconfig` (if they exist)

Determine:
- Language(s) and version(s)
- Framework(s) — determines which Framework-Specific Checks below apply
- Package manager, build tool(s), test framework(s), linter/formatter config
- Project type: `API/backend` | `frontend/SPA` | `fullstack` | `CLI tool` | `library` | `mobile` | `infra/IaC`
- Monorepo setup (workspaces, turborepo, nx, etc.)

**Output before proceeding:** Brief project profile, stack summary, and which Framework-Specific Checks will be applied.

### Phase 0.5: Context-Building (Pure Understanding)

<HARD-GATE>
This phase is FORBIDDEN from producing findings. No BLOCKs, no WARNs, no issues. Context-building only.
Rushed context = hallucinated vulnerabilities. Slow is fast.
</HARD-GATE>

For each critical module (entry points, auth, data layer, core business logic):
1. Read line-by-line. Note at minimum:
   - **3 invariants**: What MUST always be true for this code to work? (e.g., "user is authenticated before reaching this handler")
   - **5 assumptions**: What does this code assume about its inputs, environment, and callers?
   - **3 risks**: What could break if assumptions are violated?
2. Record findings as context notes — these feed into Phases 1-7, NOT into the final report directly

**Why**: Without this phase, the auditor pattern-matches against known vulnerability lists and hallucinates findings that don't exist in THIS specific codebase. The invariants + assumptions ground all later analysis in reality.

---

### Phase 1: Dependency Audit

Delegate to `dependency-doctor`. The dependency-doctor report covers:
- Vulnerability scan (CVEs by severity)
- Outdated packages (patch / minor / major)
- Unused dependencies
- Dependency health score

Pass the full dependency-doctor report through to the final audit.

---

### Phase 2: Security Audit

Delegate to `guardian`. Request a full security scan covering:
- Hardcoded secrets, API keys, tokens, passwords in source code
- OWASP Top 10: injection, broken auth, sensitive data exposure, XSS, CSRF, insecure deserialization, broken access control
- Configuration security (debug mode in prod, CORS `*`, missing HTTP security headers)
- Input validation at API boundaries
- `.gitignore` coverage of sensitive files

Pass the full guardian report through to the final audit.

---

### Phase 3: Code Quality Audit

Delegate to `autopsy` for codebase health (complexity, coupling, hotspots, dead code, health score per module).

In addition, use `Grep` to find supplementary issues autopsy may not cover:

```bash
# console.log in production code
grep -r "console\.log" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" -l

# TypeScript any types
grep -r ": any" src/ --include="*.ts" -n

# Empty catch blocks
grep -rn "catch.*{" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" -A 1 | grep -E "^\s*}"

# Python print() in production
grep -r "^print(" . --include="*.py" -l

# Rust .unwrap() outside tests
grep -rn "\.unwrap()" src/ --include="*.rs"
```

Merge autopsy report + supplementary findings.

---

### Phase 4: Architecture Audit

Use `Read` and `Grep` to evaluate structural health directly.

**4.1 Project Structure**
- Logical folder organization (business logic vs infrastructure vs presentation separated?)
- Circular dependencies between modules (A imports B, B imports A)
- Barrel file analysis (excessive re-exports causing bundle bloat)

**4.2 Design Patterns & Principles**
- Single Responsibility violations (route handlers with direct DB calls, fat controllers)
- Tight coupling between layers

```typescript
// BAD — route handler directly coupled to database
app.get('/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [req.params.id]);
  res.json(user);
});
// GOOD — layered architecture
app.get('/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await userService.getUser(req.params.id);
  res.json(user);
});
```

**4.3 API Design** (if applicable)
- Consistent naming conventions (camelCase vs snake_case in JSON responses)
- Correct HTTP method usage (GET reads, POST creates, PUT/PATCH updates, DELETE removes)
- Consistent error response format across endpoints
- Pagination on collection endpoints
- API versioning strategy

**4.4 Database Patterns** (if applicable)
- N+1 query patterns

```typescript
// BAD — N+1
const users = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users');
for (const user of users) {
  user.posts = await db.query('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = $1', [user.id]);
}
// GOOD — single JOIN
const usersWithPosts = await db.query(`
  SELECT u.*, json_agg(p.*) as posts
  FROM users u LEFT JOIN posts p ON p.user_id = u.id
  GROUP BY u.id
`);
```

- Missing indexes (check schema/migrations for columns used in WHERE/JOIN)
- Missing `LIMIT` on user-facing queries

**4.5 State Management** (frontend only)
- Global state pollution (local state handled globally)
- Prop drilling (>3 levels deep — use Context or composition)
- Data fetching patterns (caching, deduplication, stale-while-revalidate)

---

### Phase 5: Performance Audit

**5.1 Build & Bundle** (frontend)
- Tree-shaking effectiveness (importing entire libraries vs specific modules)

```typescript
// BAD — imports entire library
import _ from 'lodash';
// GOOD — tree-shakeable import
import get from 'lodash/get';
```

- Code splitting / lazy loading for routes
- Large unoptimized assets

**5.2 Runtime Performance**
- Synchronous operations that should be async (file I/O, network calls)
- Memory leak patterns (event listeners not cleaned up, growing caches, unclosed streams)
- Expensive operations in hot paths

```typescript
// BAD — regex compiled on every call
function validate(input: string) {
  return /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/.test(input);
}
// GOOD — compile once at module level
const EMAIL_REGEX = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;
function validate(input: string) { return EMAIL_REGEX.test(input); }
```

**5.3 Database & I/O**
- Missing connection pooling
- Unbounded queries (no `LIMIT` on user-facing endpoints)
- Sequential I/O that could be parallel

```typescript
// BAD — sequential when independent
const users = await fetchUsers();
const products = await fetchProducts();
// GOOD — parallel
const [users, products] = await Promise.all([fetchUsers(), fetchProducts()]);
```

---

### Phase 6: Infrastructure & DevOps Audit

Use `Glob` and `Read` to check:

**6.1 CI/CD Pipeline**
- CI config exists (`.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.circleci/`, `Jenkinsfile`)
- Tests running in CI
- Linting enforced in CI
- Security scanning in pipeline (Dependabot, Snyk, CodeQL)

**6.2 Environment Configuration**
- `.env.example` exists with placeholder values (not real secrets)
- Environment variables validated at startup

```typescript
// BAD — silently undefined
const port = process.env.PORT;
// GOOD — validate at startup
const port = process.env.PORT;
if (!port) throw new Error('PORT environment variable is required');
```

**6.3 Containerization** (if applicable)
- Dockerfile: multi-stage build, non-root user, minimal base image
- `.dockerignore` covers `node_modules`, `.git`, `.env`

**6.4 Logging & Monitoring**
- Structured logging (JSON format, not raw `console.log`)
- Error tracking integration (Sentry, Datadog, etc.)
- Health check endpoints (`/health`, `/ready`)
- No sensitive data in logs (passwords, tokens, PII)

---

### Phase 7: Documentation Audit

Use `Glob` and `Read` to check:

**7.1 Project Documentation**
- README completeness: description, prerequisites, setup, usage, deployment, contributing
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger spec, or documented endpoints)
- Can a new developer get running from README alone?
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for non-obvious choices

**7.2 Code Documentation**
- Public API / exported functions documented
- Complex business logic with explanatory comments
- `CHANGELOG.md` maintained
- `LICENSE` file present

---

### Framework-Specific Checks

Apply **only** if the framework was detected in Phase 0. Skip entirely if not relevant.

**React / Next.js** (detect: `react` or `next` in `package.json`)
- `useEffect` with missing dependencies (stale closures)
- State updates during render (infinite loop pattern)
- List items using index as key on reorderable lists
- Props drilled through 3+ levels
- Client-side hooks in Server Components (Next.js App Router)
- Components exceeding 200 JSX lines

**Node.js / Express / Fastify** (detect: `express`, `fastify`, `koa`, `@nestjs/core`)
- Missing rate limiting on public endpoints
- Missing request timeout configuration
- Error messages leaking internal details to clients
- Unbounded `SELECT *` without pagination
- Missing authentication middleware on protected routes
- Synchronous operations blocking the event loop

**Python (Django / Flask / FastAPI)** (detect: `django`, `flask`, `fastapi` in requirements)
- Django: missing `permission_classes`, `DEBUG=True` in production, missing CSRF middleware
- Flask: `app.run(debug=True)` without environment check
- FastAPI: missing Pydantic models for request/response
- Mutable default arguments (`def func(items=[])`)
- Missing type hints on public functions (if project uses mypy/pyright)

**Go** (detect: `go.mod`)
- Ignored errors (`file, _ := os.Open(filename)`)
- Goroutine leaks (goroutines without cancellation context)
- Missing `defer` for resource cleanup (files, locks, connections)
- Race conditions (shared state without mutex or channels)

**Rust** (detect: `Cargo.toml`)
- `.unwrap()` / `.expect()` in non-test production code (use `?` operator)
- `unsafe` blocks without safety comments

**Mobile (React Native / Flutter)** (detect: `react-native` in `package.json` or `pubspec.yaml`)
- FlatList without `keyExtractor` or `getItemLayout`
- Missing `React.memo` on list item components
- Flutter: missing `const` constructors, missing `dispose()` for controllers and streams

---

### Phase 8: Nexus Analytics (H3 Intelligence)

**Goal**: Surface insights about skill usage, chain patterns, and nexus health from accumulated metrics.

**Data source**: `.topia/metrics/` directory (populated by hooks automatically).

1. Check if `.topia/metrics/` exists. If not, emit INFO: "No metrics data yet — run a few build sessions first."
2. Read `.topia/metrics/skills.json` — extract per-skill invocation counts, last used dates
3. Read `.topia/metrics/sessions.jsonl` — extract session count, avg duration, avg tool calls
4. Read `.topia/metrics/chains.jsonl` — extract most common skill chains
5. Read `.topia/metrics/routing-overrides.json` (if exists) — list active routing overrides
6. Read `.topia/metrics/baseline.json` (if exists) — A/B baseline for savings comparison
7. Run `node compiler/bin/topia.js analytics --json` (or `topia metrics --json`) — extract `tokenOverview`, `tokenTrend`, `savingsVsBaseline`, `toolTokenDistribution`, `expensiveSessions`
8. Read `.topia/metrics/tools.json` if present — per-tool invocation and estimated token totals

Compute and report:
- **Top 10 most-used skills** (by total invocations)
- **Unused skills** (0 invocations across all tracked sessions) — potential dead nodes
- **Most common skill chains** (top 5 patterns from chains.jsonl)
- **Average session stats** (duration, tool calls, skill invocations)
- **Token stats** (when `sessions.jsonl` includes `tokens`):
  - Avg context peak (measured), avg estimated tokens/session, avg compactions
  - Platform split (cursor vs claude)
  - Baseline delta % if `baseline.json` present
- **Active routing overrides** and their application count
- **Top tools by estimated I/O tokens** (from `tools.json` / `toolTokenDistribution`) — candidates to reduce Read/Skill/MCP usage
- **Expensive sessions** (2+ compactions or high `context_peak`) — correlate with `pressure_level` and primary skill
- **Nexus density check**: cross-reference invocation data with declared connections — skills that are declared as "Called By" but never actually invoked may indicate broken nexus paths

**Propose routing overrides**: If patterns suggest inefficiency (e.g., debug consistently called 3+ times in a chain for the same session), propose a new routing override for user approval.

Output as a section in the final audit report:

```
### Nexus Analytics
| Skill | Invocations | Last Used | Chains Containing |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| build  | 47          | 2026-02-28| 34                |
| recon | 89          | 2026-02-28| 42                |
| ...   | ...         | ...       | ...               |

**Common Chains**:
1. build → recon → plan → test → fix → quality → verify (34x)
2. debug → recon → fix → verification (12x)

**Session Stats**: 23 sessions, avg 35min, avg 52 tool calls
**Token Stats**: avg peak ctx 94k (measured), ~4.2k est. tokens/session, 1.2 compactions/session, confidence mixed
**Baseline**: -18% vs without_topia (if baseline.json set)
**Unused Skills**: [list or "none"]
**Routing Overrides**: [count] active
```

**Shortcut**: `/topia metrics` invokes ONLY this phase, not the full 8-phase audit. CLI: `topia metrics` or `topia analytics`.

## DX Review Mode (Addy Osmani 8 Principles)

Triggered by `/topia audit dx`. Evaluates **developer experience** — how easy it is for a new contributor to understand, set up, use, and recover from mistakes in this project. Inspired by Addy Osmani's DX framework.

<HARD-GATE>
DX Review is a SEPARATE mode — it does NOT run the 8-phase health audit above.
If the user wants both, run `/topia audit` then `/topia audit dx` separately.
</HARD-GATE>

### DX Principle 1: Time to Hello World

Measure: How many steps from `git clone` to running the project?

```
1. Read README.md — extract setup instructions
2. Count discrete steps (clone, install, config, build, run)
3. Check: are ALL commands copy-pasteable? (no placeholders without explanation)
4. Check: does `npm start` / `python main.py` / equivalent work immediately after install?
5. If browser-pilot available: attempt to follow the README steps literally
```

| Steps to Run | Score | Verdict |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| 1-2 commands | 10/10 | Excellent — "clone and go" |
| 3-4 commands | 7/10 | Good — reasonable setup |
| 5-7 commands | 4/10 | Fair — friction will lose contributors |
| 8+ commands | 2/10 | Poor — significant onboarding barrier |
| Cannot run from README | 0/10 | Broken — README is lying or incomplete |

### DX Principle 2: First-Time Setup Friction

Check for common setup traps:

- Missing `.env.example` → new dev has no idea what env vars are needed
- Missing system dependency docs (e.g., needs Redis/Postgres but README doesn't say)
- Node version mismatch (no `.nvmrc` or `engines` field)
- Python version mismatch (no `python-version` in `pyproject.toml`)
- Failing install on clean machine (native deps, missing build tools)
- No `--help` or usage message when running CLI with no args

Score: count friction points. 0 = 10/10, 1-2 = 7/10, 3-4 = 4/10, 5+ = 2/10.

### DX Principle 3: Error Message Quality

Sample 5 error paths in the codebase (auth failure, invalid input, missing config, network error, permission denied). For each:

- Does the error message say WHAT went wrong? (not just "Error" or "Something went wrong")
- Does it say WHY? (context: which input, which config key)
- Does it suggest HOW to fix? (actionable: "set X in .env" not "check configuration")

| Quality | Score |
|---------|-------|
| All 3 (what + why + how) | 10/10 |
| What + why, no how | 6/10 |
| What only | 3/10 |
| Generic errors | 1/10 |

### DX Principle 4: CLI Help Quality

If project has a CLI entry point:

```
1. Run `<cli> --help` — capture output
2. Check: does it list all commands with descriptions?
3. Check: does each subcommand have `--help` with examples?
4. Check: is there a quickstart example in help output?
5. Check: are flags named predictably (--verbose not --v, --output not --o)?
```

Score: 2 points each for: command listing, subcommand help, examples, consistent naming, error on unknown flag.

If no CLI: score as N/A (does not count toward total).

### DX Principle 5: Documentation Navigation

Can a developer find answers in under 60 seconds?

- README has a table of contents or clear section headers
- API endpoints / functions have a reference page or inline docs
- Search works (if docs site): try 3 common queries
- Cross-references between related concepts exist
- No dead links (use `Grep` for `](` patterns and spot-check 5 links)

If `browser-pilot` available: navigate the docs site, time how long to find "how to authenticate" and "how to deploy".

### DX Principle 6: API Consistency

For the top 10 exported functions / API endpoints:

- Naming convention consistent? (all camelCase, or all snake_case — not mixed)
- Return type pattern consistent? (all return `{ data, error }` or all throw — not mixed)
- Parameter ordering consistent? (required first, optional last — across all functions)
- HTTP methods correct? (GET for reads, POST for creates — no GET with side effects)

Score: consistency percentage across the 10 sampled APIs.

### DX Principle 7: Progressive Disclosure

- Simple use case achievable with 1-3 lines of code? (check README examples)
- Advanced config available but not required? (sensible defaults exist)
- Configuration is layered? (env vars → config file → CLI flags → defaults)
- Type hints / IDE completion available? (`d.ts` files, JSDoc, type stubs)

### DX Principle 8: Recovery from Mistakes

- Can the user undo/rollback? (migrations have `down`, deploys have rollback, git-based workflows)
- Do destructive operations have confirmation prompts? (`--force` required for dangerous ops)
- Are error states recoverable? (retry guidance, not just "failed")
- Does `--dry-run` exist for risky operations?

### Final Report

After all phases complete:

Use `Write` to save `AUDIT-REPORT.md` to the project root with the full findings from all phases.

Call `topia:journal` to record: audit date, overall health score, verdict, and CRITICAL count.

## Weighted Composite Scoring

Each dimension score feeds into a weighted composite formula that produces a single comparable health score. Use this formula to compute **Overall Health** — not a simple average.

### Scoring Formula

```
Overall = (Security × 0.25) + (Code Quality × 0.20) + (Architecture × 0.15)
        + (Dependencies × 0.15) + (Performance × 0.10) + (Infrastructure × 0.08)
        + (Documentation × 0.07)
```

Nexus Analytics (Phase 8) is advisory — it contributes 0 to the weighted score but informs the verdict narrative.

### Grade Thresholds

| Score Range | Grade | Verdict | Action |
|-------------|-------|---------|--------|
| 90–100 | Excellent | PASS | Routine audit in 3 months |
| 75–89 | Good | PASS | Address MEDIUM items next sprint |
| 60–74 | Fair | WARNING | Fix HIGH items within 2 weeks |
| 40–59 | Poor | FAIL | Fix CRITICAL + HIGH within 1 week |
| 0–39 | Critical | FAIL | Emergency response — CRITICAL items block all new work |

### Why Weighted (not average)

Security issues cause exponential blast — a 3/10 security score with all other dimensions at 9/10 = overall 72 (Fair), not 8.1 (Good). The formula ensures security and code quality dominate the verdict. Comparable across runs: if Overall moves from 68 → 74 after fixes, the project measurably improved.


## Severity Levels

```
CRITICAL — Must fix immediately. Security vulnerabilities, data loss, broken builds.
HIGH     — Should fix soon. Performance bottlenecks, CVEs, major code smells.
MEDIUM   — Plan to fix. Code duplication, missing tests, outdated deps.
LOW      — Nice to have. Style inconsistencies, minor refactors, doc gaps.
INFO     — Observation only. Architecture notes, tech debt acknowledgment.
```

Apply confidence filtering: only report findings with >80% confidence. Consolidate similar issues (e.g., "12 functions missing error handling in src/services/" — not 12 separate findings). Adapt judgment to project type (a `console.log` in a CLI tool is fine; in a production API handler, it's not).

## Output Format

### Top Priority Actions
1. [action] — [file:line] — [why it matters]

### Positive Findings
- [at least 3 things the project does well]

### Follow-up Timeline
- FAIL → re-audit in 1-2 weeks after CRITICAL fixes
- WARNING → re-audit in 1 month
- PASS → routine audit in 3 months

Report saved to: AUDIT-REPORT.md
```

## Constraints

1. MUST complete all 8 phases (Phase 8 may report "no data" if .topia/metrics/ doesn't exist yet) — if any phase is skipped, state explicitly which phase and why
2. MUST delegate Phase 1 to dependency-doctor and Phase 2 to guardian — no manual replacements
3. MUST apply confidence filter — only report findings with >80% confidence; consolidate similar issues
4. MUST include at least 3 positive findings — an audit with no positives is incomplete
5. MUST produce quantified health scores (1-10 per dimension) — not vague "needs work"
6. MUST NOT fabricate findings — every finding requires a specific file:line citation
7. MUST save AUDIT-REPORT.md before declaring completion

## Nexus Gates

| Gate | Requires | If Missing |
|------|----------|------------|
| Discovery Gate | Phase 0 project profile completed before Phase 1 | Run recon and read config files first |
| Security Gate | guardian report received before assembling final report | Invoke topia:guardian — do not skip |
| Deps Gate | dependency-doctor report received before assembling final report | Invoke topia:dependency-doctor — do not skip |
| Report Gate | All 8 phases completed before writing AUDIT-REPORT.md | Complete all phases, note skipped ones |

## Returns

| Artifact | Format | Location |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Audit report | Markdown | `AUDIT-REPORT.md` (project root) |
| 8-dimension health score | Markdown table | `AUDIT-REPORT.md` + inline |
| Weighted composite score + grade | Markdown | inline + `AUDIT-REPORT.md` |
| Nexus analytics section | Markdown table | inline + `AUDIT-REPORT.md` |
| Journal entry | Text | `.topia/adr/` (via `topia:journal`) |

## Sharp Edges

| Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Generating health scores from file name patterns instead of actual reads | CRITICAL | Phase 0 recon run is mandatory — never score without reading actual code |
| Skipping a phase because "there are no changes in that area" | HIGH | All 7 phases run for every audit — partial audits produce misleading scores |
| Health score inflation — no negative findings in any dimension | MEDIUM | CONSTRAINT: minimum 3 positive AND 3 improvement areas required |
| Dependency-doctor or guardian sub-call times out → skipped silently | MEDIUM | Mark phase as "incomplete — tool timeout" with N/A score, do not fabricate |

## Done When

- All 8 phases completed (or explicitly marked N/A with reason)
- Health score calculated from actual file reads per dimension (not estimated)
- At least 3 positive findings and 3 improvement areas documented
- AUDIT-REPORT.md written to project root
- Journal entry recorded with audit date, score, and CRITICAL count
- Structured report emitted with overall health score and verdict

## Cost Profile

~8000-20000 tokens input, ~3000-6000 tokens output. Sonnet orchestrating; guardian (sonnet/opus) and autopsy (opus) are the expensive sub-calls. Full audit runs 4 sub-skills. Most thorough L2 skill — run on demand, not on every cycle.
