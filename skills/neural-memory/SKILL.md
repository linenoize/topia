# neural-memory

## Purpose

Bridges Topia's file-based persistence (session-bridge, journal) with Neural Memory MCP's semantic graph. While session-bridge saves decisions to `.topia/` files and journal tracks ADRs locally, neural-memory captures **cross-project learnable patterns** — decisions, error root causes, architectural insights, and workflow preferences — into a persistent cognitive layer that compounds across every project and session.

Without this skill, each project is an island. With it, a caching pattern discovered in Project A auto-surfaces when Project B faces a similar problem.

## Triggers

**Auto-trigger:**
- Session start → Run **Recall Mode** (load relevant context before any work)
- After `build` completes a feature → Run **Capture Mode** (save learnings)
- After `debug` finds root cause → Run **Capture Mode** (save error pattern)
- After `review` finds issues → Run **Capture Mode** (save code quality insight)
- After `rescue` completes a phase → Run **Capture Mode** (save refactoring pattern)
- After `journal` writes an ADR → Run **Capture Mode** (extract to nmem)
- Session end / before compaction → Run **Flush Mode** (capture remaining context)

**Manual trigger:**
- `/topia remember <text>` — save a specific memory (Capture Mode)
- `/topia brain-health` — check neural memory health + maintenance
- `/topia hypothesize <question>` — start hypothesis tracking

For unified cross-source recall (`.topia/`, `.remember/`, MCP), use **`topia:recall`** instead.

## Calls (outbound)

- `session-bridge` (L3): after Capture Mode — sync key decisions back to `.topia/` files

## Optional MCP Backend: agora-code

`neural-memory` is backed by the Neural Memory MCP server by default. When the **`agora-memory` MCP server** (vendored from `mcp-servers/agora-code/`) is also registered, `neural-memory` SHOULD route a subset of operations to it for stronger codebase intelligence:

| Operation | Default backend | If `agora-memory` available |
|---|---|---|
| Capture (`store learning`) | `nmem_remember` | Additionally call `store_learning` so the decision is keyword-indexed in the SQLite store |
| Recall (`search learnings`) | `nmem_recall` | Also call `recall_learnings` — merge results, dedupe by similarity |
| Symbol lookup ("what does function X do?") | _(not supported)_ | Call `get_file_symbols` / `search_symbols` — agora-code's symbol index is authoritative for line-numbered lookups |
| File history | _(not supported)_ | Call `recall_file_history` — agora-code tracks per-session file changes |

**Graceful degradation**: detect `agora-memory` in the active MCP list before routing. If missing, behavior is identical to today — pure Neural Memory MCP. Never BLOCK on agora-code's absence. See `docs/mcp-integrations/agora-code.md`.

## Called By (inbound)

- `build` (L1): Phase 0 (resume) + Phase 8 (complete) — recall context at start, capture learnings at end
- `rescue` (L1): phase start + phase end — recall past refactoring patterns, capture new ones
- `debug` (L2): after root cause found — capture error pattern for future recognition
- `fix` (L2): after fix verified — capture fix pattern (cause → solution)
- `review` (L2): after review complete — capture code quality insight
- `plan` (L2): before architecture decisions — recall past decisions on similar problems
- `guardian` (L2): after security finding — capture vulnerability pattern
- `incident` (L2): after resolution — capture incident root cause + fix
- `retro` (L2): during retrospective — capture retro insights and patterns
- `session-bridge` (L3): Step 6 (cross-project extraction) — extract generalizable patterns
- `journal` (L3): after ADR written — extract decision + rejected alternatives
- `context-engine` (L3): before compaction — trigger Flush Mode to preserve context
- `recall` (L3): MCP recall leg of unified cross-source recall report

## Modes

### Mode 1: Recall (Session Start / Before Decisions)

Load relevant context from neural memory before starting work.

**Step 1 — Identify Recall Topics**
Read `.topia/progress.md` and current task context to determine 3-5 diverse recall topics.
Always prefix queries with the project name to avoid cross-project noise.

```
GOOD: "Topia compiler cross-reference resolution"
GOOD: "MyTrend PocketBase auth session handling"
BAD:  "cross-reference" (too generic, returns all projects)
BAD:  "auth" (returns noise from every project)
```

**Step 2 — Execute Recall**
Call `nmem_recall` for each topic. Use diverse angles:
- Technology-specific: `"<project> React state management"`
- Problem-specific: `"<project> caching strategy decision"`
- Pattern-specific: `"<project> error handling approach"`

**Step 3 — Synthesize Context**
Summarize recalled memories into actionable context:
- Decisions that apply to current task
- Patterns that worked (or failed) before
- Constraints or preferences from past sessions
- Open hypotheses still being tracked

**Step 4 — Surface Gaps**
If recall returns thin results for the current domain, note the gap.
Call `nmem_gaps(action="detect")` if working in a domain with sparse memories.

---

### Mode 2: Capture (After Task Completion)

When triggered after `topia:journal` writes an ADR: read the ADR file, extract decision + rejected alternatives. If journal already called agora `store_learning`, tag `source: journal-adr` and skip duplicate `store_learning`.


Extract learnable patterns from completed work and save to neural memory.

**Step 1 — Classify What Happened**
Determine which memory types to create from the completed task:

| What happened | Memory type | Priority | Example |
|---------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Chose approach A over B | `decision` | 7 | "Chose Zustand over Redux because single-store simpler for this scale" |
| Found and fixed a bug | `error` | 7 | "Root cause was stale closure in useEffect — fixed by adding dep array" |
| Discovered a reusable pattern | `insight` | 6 | "This codebase uses barrel exports for every feature module" |
| Learned user preference | `preference` | 8 | "User prefers Phosphor Icons over Lucide for all UI work" |
| Established a workflow | `workflow` | 6 | "Deploy: build → test → push → verify CI → tag" |
| Found a fact worth keeping | `fact` | 5 | "API rate limit is 100 req/min for this endpoint" |
| Received instruction to follow | `instruction` | 8 | "Always run prettier before commit in this project" |

**Step 2 — Craft Rich Memories**
Each memory MUST use cognitive language patterns for strong neural connections:

```
BAD:  "PostgreSQL" (flat, no context — orphan neuron)
GOOD: "Chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB because ACID needed for payment processing"

BAD:  "Fixed auth bug" (no root cause — useless for future recall)
GOOD: "Auth cookie expired silently because SameSite=Lax blocked cross-origin. Fixed by setting SameSite=None + Secure flag"

BAD:  "React project structure" (vague — won't match specific queries)
GOOD: "Topia compiler uses 3-stage pipeline: Parse SKILL.md → Transform cross-refs → Emit per-platform files"
```

**Cognitive patterns to use:**
- **Causal**: "X caused Y because Z", "Root cause was X which led to Y"
- **Temporal**: "After upgrading to v3, the middleware broke because of new cookie format"
- **Decisional**: "Chose X over Y because Z", "Rejected X due to Y"
- **Comparative**: "X is 3x faster than Y for read-heavy workloads"
- **Relational**: "X depends on Y", "X replaced Y", "X connects to Y through Z"

**Step 3 — Tag and Prioritize**
Every memory MUST include:
- **Tags**: `[project-name, technology, topic]` — lowercase, specific
- **Priority**: 5 (normal), 7-8 (important decisions/errors), 9-10 (critical security/breaking)
- **Max length**: 1-3 sentences. If longer, split into focused pieces.

**Step 4 — Save Memories**
Call `nmem_remember` for each memory. Save 2-5 memories per completed task:
- A bug fix has: root cause, fix approach, prevention insight
- A feature has: architecture decision, pattern used, trade-off made
- A review has: quality issue found, fix suggestion, pattern to avoid

**Step 5 — Reinforce Connections**
After saving, call `nmem_recall` on the topic to reinforce new neural connections.
This activates related neurons and strengthens the memory graph.

### Mode 3: Hypothesis Tracking

Track uncertain decisions with evidence over time.

**Step 1 — Form Hypothesis**
When making an uncertain architectural or design decision:
```
nmem_hypothesize("Redis will handle our session load better than Memcached
                   because our access pattern is 80% reads with complex data types")
```

**Step 2 — Collect Evidence**
As you work, update the hypothesis with evidence:
```
nmem_evidence(hypothesis_id, "Redis handled 10K concurrent sessions with
              p99 < 5ms in load test — SUPPORTS hypothesis")

nmem_evidence(hypothesis_id, "Memory usage 2x higher than Memcached estimate
              — WEAKENS hypothesis for memory-constrained deployments")
```

**Step 3 — Make Predictions**
Create falsifiable predictions:
```
nmem_predict("If we switch to Redis Cluster, session failover time will drop
              from 30s to < 2s")
```

**Step 4 — Verify Outcomes**
After deployment/testing, verify:
```
nmem_verify(prediction_id, outcome="Failover time dropped to 1.2s — CONFIRMED")
```

---

### Mode 4: Flush (Session End / Pre-Compaction)

Capture remaining context before session ends.

**Step 1 — Scan Unsaved Context**
Review the current session for:
- Decisions made but not yet captured
- Errors encountered and their resolutions
- Patterns discovered during exploration
- User preferences expressed

**Step 2 — Batch Save**
Call `nmem_auto(action="process", text="<session summary>")` with a concise summary
of the session's key outcomes, decisions, and learnings.

**Step 3 — Update Session Bridge**
If significant decisions were captured, also call `session-bridge` to sync
the most important ones to `.topia/decisions.md` for local persistence.

---

### Mode 5: Maintenance (Weekly / On-Demand)

Keep the neural memory healthy and useful.

**Step 1 — Health Check**
Call `nmem_health()` to assess brain status. Key metrics:
- Consolidation % (low = run consolidation)
- Orphan % (>20% = pTopia disconnected memories)
- Activation levels (low = recall more diverse topics)
- Connectivity (low = use richer cognitive language)
- Diversity (low = vary memory types)

**Step 2 — Consolidation**
If brain has >100 memories or consolidation is low:
```
nmem_consolidate  — merge episodic → semantic memories
```

**Step 3 — Review Queue**
Call `nmem_review(action="queue")` to surface memories needing attention:
- Outdated decisions that may no longer apply
- Low-confidence memories that need evidence
- Wall-of-text memories (>500 chars) that should be split

**Step 4 — Corrections**
Fix bad memories:
- Wrong type → `nmem_edit(memory_id, type="correct_type")`
- Wrong content → `nmem_edit(memory_id, content="corrected text")`
- Outdated → `nmem_forget(memory_id, reason="outdated")`
- Sensitive/garbage → `nmem_forget(memory_id, hard=true)`

**Step 5 — Connection Tracing**
Use `nmem_explain(entity_a, entity_b)` to trace paths between concepts.
Useful for understanding why certain memories surface together.

### Recommended Actions

```

## Constraints

1. **MUST prefix all recall queries with project name** — generic queries return cross-project noise that confuses the AI. The ONLY exception is intentional cross-project searches.
2. **MUST use rich cognitive language** — flat facts ("X exists") create orphan neurons with zero connections. Every memory MUST include WHY, BECAUSE, or relationship context.
3. **MUST NOT save wall-of-text memories** — max 1-3 sentences per memory. Split longer content into focused pieces. Memories >500 chars degrade recall quality.
4. **MUST NOT duplicate file-based state** — don't save task progress, file paths, or git history to nmem. Those belong in `.topia/` files (session-bridge) or git. nmem is for *learnable patterns* only.
5. **MUST save 2-5 memories per completed task** — a single memory per task is insufficient. Capture the decision, the reasoning, the pattern, and the prevention insight separately.
6. **MUST NOT save sensitive data** — no API keys, passwords, tokens, or PII. Mask or omit sensitive values.
7. **MUST tag every memory** — always include `[project-name, technology, topic]`. Tags enable future recall precision.

## Sharp Edges

| Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-project noise from generic queries | HIGH | Always prefix queries with project name. Use `nmem_explain` to trace unexpected connections |
| Orphan neurons from flat facts | HIGH | Enforce cognitive language patterns (causal, decisional, comparative). Run `nmem_health` to detect orphan % |
| Memory bloat from over-saving | MEDIUM | Cap at 5 memories per task. Run `nmem_consolidate` weekly. Use `nmem_review` to pTopia |
| Stale decisions applied to changed codebase | MEDIUM | Include temporal context ("As of v2.1, ..."). Verify recalled decisions against current code before applying |
| Duplicate memories from repeated sessions | MEDIUM | Before saving, `nmem_recall` the topic first to check for existing memories. Update rather than create duplicates |
| Loss of nuance from oversimplification | LOW | Save rejected alternatives alongside chosen approach. Use `nmem_hypothesize` for uncertain decisions |
