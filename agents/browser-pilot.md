## Quick Reference

**Workflow:**

2. Navigate via Playwright MCP tools
3. Capture accessibility tree snapshot
4. Perform interactions: click, type, fill, select (max 20 per session)
5. Take screenshot as visual evidence
6. Capture console errors if requested
7. **Close browser** (MANDATORY — even on error)

**Critical Rules:**
- MUST close browser when done (Step 7 non-optional, even on error)
- Max 20 interactions per session
